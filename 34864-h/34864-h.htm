<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>OLD MONMOUTH</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Monmouth is an expression dear to
the heart of every native-born Jerseyman.
The occasional visitor seeking health among
its whispering pines, or relaxation in the sultry
summer days along its shore, where the roll
of the breakers and the boundless sweep of
the ocean combine to form one of the most
sublime marine views on all the Atlantic seaboard,
may admire the fertile farmlands and
prosperous villages as much as the man to the
manor born, but he never speaks of "Old"
Monmouth.</p>

<p>Nor will he fully understand what the purebred
Jerseyman means when he uses the term,
for to the stranger the word will smack of
length of days, and of the venerable position
which Monmouth holds among the counties
of the State.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Monmouth is old, it is true, and was among
the first of the portions of New Jersey to be
settled by the Woapsiel Lennape, the name
which the Indians first gave to the white
people from across the sea, or by the Schwonnack,&mdash;"the
salt people,"&mdash;as the Delawares
afterwards called them. But the true
Jerseyman is not thinking alone of the age
of Monmouth when he uses the word "Old."
To him it is a term of affection also, used it
may be as schoolboys or college mates use it
when they address one another as "old fellow,"
though but a few years may have passed
over their heads.</p>

<p>The new-comer or the stranger may speak
of Fair Monmouth, and think he is giving
all the honor due to the beautiful region, but
his failure to use the proper adjective will at
once betray his foreign birth and his ignorance
of the position which the county holds
in the affections of all true Jerseymen.</p>

<p>Still, Monmouth is old in the sense in
which the summer visitor uses the word.
Here and there in the county an antiquated
house is standing to-day, which if it were
endowed with the power of speech could tell
of stirring sights it had seen more than a
century ago. Redcoats, fleeing from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
wrath of the angry Washington and his Jersey
Blues, marched swiftly past on their way
to the Highlands and the refuge of New
York. Fierce contests between neighbors,
who had taken opposite sides in the struggle
of the colonies for freedom from the yoke of
the mother country, or step-mother country,
as some not inappropriately termed her in
these days, occurred in the presence of these
ancient dwelling-places, and sometimes within
their very walls. Many, too, would be the
stories of the deeds of tories, and refugees,
and pine robbers contending with stanch and
sturdy whigs. Up the many winding streams,
boat-loads of sailors made their way from the
gunboat or privateer anchored off the shore,
to burn the salt works of the hardy pioneers,
or lay waste their lands as they searched for
plunder or for forage.</p>

<p>The forked trees along the shore, in whose
branches the lookouts were concealed as they
swept the ocean for miles watching for the
appearance of the hostile boat, were standing
until recent years. In their last days broken,
it is true, and almost destroyed by the winter
storms and their weight of long years, still
they stood as the few remaining tokens of
that century when our fathers contended for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
"their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred
honor." At last the pathos and weakness of
old age prevailed, and to-day there remains
scarcely a vestige of those ancient landmarks.</p>

<p>Perhaps if the boys and girls of New Jersey
had been as mindful of those old trees as the
Cambridge lads and lassies have been of the
spreading elm beneath whose branches the
noble-hearted Washington assumed the command
of the little American army, some of
them might still be standing; but as it is,
the most of them have crumbled and fallen
and disappeared as completely as have the
men who sought the shelter of their branches
in the trying times of '78.</p>

<p>So, too, for many years stood the famous
tree from whose limbs the noble patriot, Captain
Huddy, was hanged,&mdash;as dastardly a
deed as was committed by either side in that
struggle which tried the souls of our fathers.
But the trees are gone, and only a few quaint
houses and venerable landmarks and heirlooms
remain of those things which witnessed
the contests, and deeds high or base, of that
far-away time.</p>

<p>The lofty monument on the old battle-ground
of Monmouth is surmounted by the
figure of a man whose face is shaded by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
hand, as if he were still striving to obtain a
glimpse of the redcoats in the darkness as
they hastened to gain the Highlands and the
refuge of the waiting boats which were to
bear them away to the safety of the great
city. But it is itself essentially modern, and
only in its brief records, carved by patriotic
hands upon its sides, and in its figure of the
granite soldier standing upon its summit, does
its suggestiveness lie. It looks down upon a
thriving village and out upon the lands of
thrifty and prosperous farmers, and there is
nothing in all the vision to remind one that
the soil was ever stained by the blood of soldiers
clad in uniforms of scarlet, or of buff
and blue.</p>

<p>And yet, as fierce a struggle as our country
ever knew occurred within the region.
Women toiled in the fields while their husbands
and sons fought, or even gave up their
lives to drive away their oppressors. Yes,
even in the battles some of the women found
places, and Captain Molly Pitcher was only
one among many who had a share in the
actual struggle of the Revolution. Houses
were doubly barred at night against the attacks
of prowling bands of refugees or pine
robbers, and many times were defended by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the patriotic women themselves. Spies crept
in among them, and evil men who owned no
allegiance to either side seized the opportunity
to prey alike upon friend and foe. At times
it almost seemed as if the words spoken many
centuries ago were then fulfilled, and that "a
man was set at variance against his father,
and the daughter against her mother, and the
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, and
that a man's foes were they of his own household."</p>

<p>But with all the suffering and bloodshed
there were many heroes and heroines, and
even the boys and girls were not without a
share in the struggles of the times which
tried men's souls. The houses in which they
dwelt may have disappeared and given place
to far more imposing structures; their very
names may no longer be recalled; but, after
all, they displayed many qualities which the
world ought not willingly to permit to die,
and the heritage which they have bequeathed
to us will lose nothing of its value if we go
back in our thoughts and strive to comprehend
more clearly the price which our fathers
paid for the land we love.</p>

<p>In the early summer of 1778, while the
feelings of the Monmouth people had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
deeply stirred,&mdash;and indeed the patriots of
the county had been among the foremost to
pass resolutions and be enrolled among the
defenders of the new nation,&mdash;there had not
as yet come the intense excitement which
followed the advance of General Clinton's
army from Philadelphia. The long winter at
Valley Forge had at last come to an end, and
when the British moved out from the city,&mdash;for
holding it longer seemed to be useless,&mdash;Washington
had led his troops into the town
almost as soon as the enemy departed. Nor
was that all, for he quickly decided to follow
after the departing general, and overtake and
give him battle before Clinton could lead his
men across the Jerseys.</p>

<p>The American commander knew that his
own forces numbered nearly as many as those
the British general had; and as, in spite of
the dreadful sufferings of the winter, his men
were in far better condition than they had ever
been before,&mdash;thanks to the tireless energy
of Baron Steuben,&mdash;he resolved to depart
from Philadelphia and follow after the British.</p>

<p>Clinton had sent the recently enrolled tories
to New York by water, and as there were
some three thousand of these alone, he soon
decided that his troops must go by land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, the journey was begun, but
the Continentals, going a little farther to the
north than the line of Clinton's march, planned
to gain a position in advance of the enemy by
the rapidity of their movements, and then,
turning about in their course, fall upon the
redcoats face to face and offer them battle in
some advantageous place.</p>

<p>The baggage wagons of Clinton stretched
out in a long line of twelve miles as they followed
after the army, and in other ways the
British leader was somewhat embarrassed.
Consequently, when he learned of Washington's
plan, he quickly decided to change
the direction of his march, and, by passing
through "Old Monmouth," lead his army to
the Navesink Highlands and there have them
all embark for New York.</p>

<p>Washington had first offered the command
of his advance forces to young Lafayette, but
he was somewhat perplexed by the return of
General Lee to his army, and knew not just
what to do.</p>

<p>Lee had been captured a little more than a
year before this time, through his own carelessness,
near Morristown, and we may be sure
that Washington was not greatly troubled by
the loss. Lee had steadily opposed him, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was plotting to secure his position for himself.
However, the British general Prescott,
whose capture by the Americans had been
effected in a manner not unlike that in
which Lee himself had been taken, had been
exchanged, and Lee once more returned to
the American army.</p>

<p>He was still the same Lee, sensitive, jealous,
and suspected of being in league with
Howe, who recently had sailed away for England
to explain to Parliament the causes of
his failures in the preceding year.</p>

<p>Much as he disliked to make the change,
Lee's return compelled Washington to recognize
his presence, and after some tactful efforts
he removed Lafayette and gave Lee his position
as leader of the advanced forces. Lee
had bitterly opposed the project of following
Clinton, and steadily objected to the march
across the Jerseys.</p>

<p>Washington, however, was firm in his determination,
and the march was soon begun;
but the lack of confidence which he felt in
General Lee must have sadly increased the
troubles of the great commander, already
beset by perils of so many kinds. Whether
he was mistaken in his estimate of the man,
we shall learn in the course of this story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Such then was the general condition of affairs
as the summer of 1778 drew on. Those
of the people of Old Monmouth who were at
home heard occasional rumors of the advance
of the two armies, but few of them had any
thought of the stirring scenes which were to
be enacted in their midst before the summer
was ended.</p>

<p>It was now late in June. The summer had
been unusually warm, and the men and boys,
as well as the women, who were at home had
labored busily in the fields, in the hope of an
early as well as an abundant harvest. For
those who cared to avail themselves of them,
the markets in New York provided a ready
place for the sale of their produce, and not
only the tories, but some of the men whose
sympathies as yet had not led them openly to
declare their preferences for either side, or
who perhaps cared more for the prices they
were likely to receive in New York for the
results of their labors than they did for liberty
or any such abstract quality, were not
averse to loading up the boats, which many
of the farmers near the shore owned, and
sailing away for the city.</p>

<p>Down the lower bay one such boat was
swiftly making its way one afternoon in June,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
1778. On board were four men, three of
whom evidently were in middle life, but the
fourth was a sturdy lad about seventeen years
of age, and it was plain that he was not in
full sympathy with his companions. He took
but little part in the conversation, and the
expression upon his face frequently betrayed
the feelings in his heart. The three men
with him apparently did not give him much
thought or attention, and evidently were too
well satisfied with the results of their expedition
to waste any time in questioning the lad
as to the cause of his silence.</p>

<p>"There's the old tree now," said one of
the men as they came within sight of the
landmark. "If nothing has gone wrong,
we'll soon be in the Navesink."</p>

<p>"Yes, and back at work again," grumbled
another. "For my part I think Fenton and
Davenport and the rest of the pine robbers
have the easiest time of all. They swoop
down upon some whig farmer, and all they
have to do is to take what he has worked
out. I don't see why it isn't all fair enough
in war."</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for that skull of Fagan, with
that pipe stuck in its mouth, nailed up on the
tree over there beyond the Court House, I'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
go in myself," said the first speaker. "The
grin on it is almost more than I can bear."</p>

<p>"That'll do to frighten women and children
with," said the third man, who had been
silent for a time. "Fagan got a little too
bold, that was the trouble with him. He
carried it a little too far. I happen to know
that there are some men who know enough
to put a finger in, and not get it burned
either."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you've done a little yourself in
that line, Benzeor Osburn?" queried the last
speaker. "I've thought sometimes you could
tell some tales if you wanted to."</p>

<p>"And who knows but I might?" replied
Benzeor. "I may be able to keep my place
from being confiscated and sold, the way my
brother's was two years ago, but that may not
mean either that I don't know what's to my
own advantage when I see it. You'd do the
same, wouldn't you, Jacob Vannote?"</p>

<p>"That I would," replied Jacob, "and so
would Barzilla Giberson here, too. All we
want is that some good man like you, Benzeor,
should tell us how to do it."</p>

<p>"I can tell you," said Benzeor quietly.
"I've made up my mind that I've held off
just as long as I am going to. I'm going in,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and if you have a mind to join, I'll let you
in, too."</p>

<p>"Tell us about it," said Jacob eagerly.
"What about the boy?" he added in a low
voice, glancing toward the fourth member of
the party as he spoke.</p>

<p>"What? Tom Coward? He's a coward
by name as well as by nature. You haven't
anything to fear from him. He's been in my
home since he was five year old. He won't
make any trouble."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the speaker lowered his voice,
and for a long time the trio conversed eagerly
upon the new topic. So intent were they that
not one of them noted the flush upon the
lad's face at the brutal reference to him, nor
saw the look of determination which came a
little later in its place.</p>

<p>Apparently Tom was not giving any attention
to the men with him in the swift sailing
boat. He retained his seat near the bow, and
seemed to be interested only in the waves
before him. A brisk wind was blowing, and
the waters betrayed the tokens of a coming
storm.</p>

<p>The boat was pitching more and more as it
sped on, and Tom watched the rolling waves,
many of them capped with white and rising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
steadily higher and higher. The darker hues
gave place to a lighter green as they rose, and
the increasing roughness seemed to reflect
somewhat the feelings in his own heart.</p>

<p>Far away in the distance stretched the long
sandy beach of the Hook, becoming more and
more distinct as the boat drew nearer. The
gulls were flying low, and the weird cries of
the sea-birds were heard on every side.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom stood upright, and, after
gazing intently for a moment at some object
on the shore, turned to his companions and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some one's up in the tree, and the signal's
out, too."</p>

<p>The men instantly ceased from their conversation,
and peered intently at the tree in the
distance.</p>

<p>Evidently the sight was not altogether
pleasing, for with an exclamation of anger
Benzeor Osburn, who was holding the tiller,
quickly changed the course of the boat, and
started back in the direction from which they
had come.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TOM INVESTIGATES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were many exclamations of impatience
heard in the boat as Benzeor changed
her course, and the helmsman himself appeared
to be the most impatient of all. A
drizzling rain was now falling and there were
many signs apparent that a stormy night was
approaching.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew just what the warning was
for," muttered Benzeor. "Fine night this,
to be prowling around the bay in!"</p>

<p>"There was no mistake about the sign,
though," replied Jacob. "There's something
wrong, or we shouldn't have seen the white
flag. That means there's something going
on up the Navesink."</p>

<p>"All the more reason for going home
then!" said Benzeor. "Who was on the
lookout to-day? Does any one know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, 't was Peter Van Mater," said Tom,
who up to this time had taken no part in the
conversation. "He told me yesterday that
he was to be in the tree to-day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"What! Little Peter?" demanded Benzeor
quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tom. "I saw him out by
their cornfield yesterday. He was there driving
away the crows and blackbirds."</p>

<p>"Little" Peter was so called to distinguish
him from his father who bore the same name;
and although his son, a well-grown young
fellow of eighteen, towered more than a half
head above "Big" Peter now, the distinctive
names given several years before this time still
clung to them both.</p>

<p>The Van Mater place joined the Osburn
farm, and for years Tom and Little Peter had
been the best of friends. On those rare occasions
when a brief break in the arduous labors
on the farms had come, together they had
gone crabbing, or had sailed down to Barnegat,
where the sea-fowl gathered in great
flocks when the proper seasons came.</p>

<p>Tom's heart had gone out to Little Peter
as it had not to any other person. Peter's
round face shone with an expression of good
nature which nothing but the mention of a
tory or a pine robber seemed to be able to
ruffle. A reference to either of them never
failed to arouse the dormant anger of the
lad, and with all the intensity of his quiet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and strong nature he hated both. For the
Van Maters, even to the mother and the
girls, were patriots of the strongest kind, and
now Big Peter was away in Washington's
army and had left his eldest son and namesake
to protect the family and manage the
farm in his absence.</p>

<p>And Little Peter had accepted the task with
an outward assent that deceived even his own
father. Only to Tom had he mentioned his
true feelings, and expressed his determination
to buy up his time, so that he, too, might be
enrolled in the patriot army.</p>

<p>Tom Coward well knew that the words
expressed Little Peter's feelings and desires
rather than his purpose, for he was satisfied
that nothing would induce his friend to desert
his mother and the children in their
time of need. But he had fully sympathized
with Peter in his desire to buy up his time,
and there were special reasons why the words
meant much more to him than they did to his
friend.</p>

<p>About a decade before this time, when one
of the numerous "September gales" was
raging along the Jersey shore, a great crowd
had assembled on the beach watching the
efforts of a schooner they could see, about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a mile out on the ocean, to weather the storm.
All day long the crowd had remained there,
powerless to aid the stricken people on board
the storm-tossed boat, for this was long before
the time of the life-saving crews and
their noble work along the coast.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon on that eventful day,
when the storm had abated somewhat, although
the waves, like moving mountains of
water, still came thundering in upon the beach,
a boat had been manned and started forth to
the aid of the people in their peril; but before
the brave band could gain the schooner, she
had foundered and gone to the bottom.</p>

<p>The men who had gone forth to the rescue
had been about to return to the shore, when
they thought they saw something floating
over the boisterous waves toward them. When
a second glance was obtained they started
swiftly toward the object, and, as they drew
near, saw a huge cotton bale with a woman
and a little lad strapped upon it. At last,
after some desperate efforts, the bodies were
rescued, but that of the woman was lifeless
and that of the lad was nearly so.</p>

<p>The rough men had brought both ashore,
and, after some labor on the part of the women
in the assembly, the lad had been restored,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
but the woman was beyond all earthly
aid. Upon some of the clothing of the rescued
boy the name Coward had been found,
and "Tom" was improvised, for that would
do as well as any other for the name of a
stranger lad whose home and parents were to
be, as the people of Old Monmouth thought,
forever wrapped in mystery.</p>

<p>Tom Coward had been the sole survivor of
the wreck. For days some portions of the
ill-fated schooner and its cargo were washed
ashore, but no clue was ever found as to her
name or destination.</p>

<p>What to do with the rescued lad then
became the perplexing problem among the
simple folk of Monmouth, and it was at last
solved by "binding him out" to Benzeor Osburn,
which simply meant that Tom was to
live with the man who had taken him until
he was twenty-one years of age, and in return
for the home he received he was to give his
labor and life until that eventful day should
arrive when he, too, would become a man.</p>

<p>The lad had gone, for he had no voice in
the matter, and all the home he had ever
known had been with Benzeor and his family.
Only a faint recollection of the wreck remained
in his mind, but he had heard the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
story many times and thought much over it
in secret. Often had he visited the unmarked
grave in the churchyard, where he was informed
that all that was mortal of his mother
lay resting. But her name and face were both
alike unknown to him. In his dreams, or when
he had been working alone in some of the distant
fields, it would almost seem to him that
something of another existence would rise
before him, or that he could almost see the
face of a gracious woman bending low over
him whom he could call "mother."</p>

<p>Who he might be he could not determine.
Who he was, was a matter much more easily
settled, for all knew him as the "bound
boy" of Benzeor Osburn; and while some
of the country people might occasionally think
of him as the little lad, who years before had
been rescued from a sinking schooner, they
seldom referred to it, and the past had been
crowded out by the present. But Tom Coward
had not entirely forgotten.</p>

<p>Benzeor had received him into his home
the more readily because, as he expressed it,
"all of his boys had been born girls," and he
felt the need of the aid and presence of a boy
about the place. And Benzeor in his way had
not been unkind to the stranger lad, or at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
least not intentionally so, but the labor on the
farms in those days had been severe, and he
was a man to whom money had been the one
thing needful. He did not spare himself, and
certainly he had no thought of sparing those
who were dependent upon him; and, as a
natural consequence, neither the girls nor Tom,
and much less the overworked, spiritless little
mother of the family, found much to relieve
the monotonous round of labor on the farm.</p>

<p>At first, Tom had not complained and had
accepted all as a matter of course, but of late
his heart had rebelled against his lot more
and more. It was not that he did not appreciate
the rough kindness which was extended to
him, especially by the patient, uncomplaining
mother and the two girls, Sarah and Mercy,
who were nearest his own age. But certain
undefined longings kept rising in his soul, he
knew not how, and the increasing eagerness
of Benzeor "to make his place pay" had apparently
driven all else from the mind of his
foster father.</p>

<p>Perhaps more than any of these things,
his interviews with his friend Little Peter
had stirred his soul, for Peter had longings,
too, and, as has been said, had even declared
his intention "to buy up his own time." That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
he was a son in his own home, and was surrounded
by the love of father and mother, had
not made the purpose in Peter's heart appear
in the least strange or unusual, for the custom
was not unknown among those sturdy forefathers
of ours. When they had cared for a
boy in his infancy and helpless years, it was
considered as no more than a just return that
the years of early manhood, which would naturally
be of value to the fathers in their labors
on the farms, should belong not to the son
but to the father. So whenever a well-grown
boy felt that he would like to start in for
himself, it was not unusual for him to offer,
or to promise to pay as soon as he could earn
the money, the amount which was considered
as a fair equivalent for the value of his services
in the few years before he became "of
age," and could enter upon his own career.</p>

<p>In those days the obligation of the child to
his father was emphasized. In our own time
the obligation of the father to his child is
considered the more important, and all that
love and devotion can offer are laid at the
feet of the children.</p>

<p>Perhaps justice lies somewhere between
these two extremes, and no one of us desires
to return to the harsher methods of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
earlier years; but certainly the children who
are so fortunate as to be born in these more
fortunate times have some need of recalling
the words of one who, long before the trying
days of the Revolution, exhorted all to "honor
their fathers and mothers."</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Tom Coward thought
much and long over his friend Peter's project,
and even went so far at one time as
to hint to Benzeor that he would not be
averse to entering into some such arrangement
with him. But Benzeor's indignation,
and the grief with which Sarah heard of the
proposal, had silenced him, and he had not
referred to the matter again.</p>

<p>None the less, however, did it remain in
his thoughts, and of late the suspicion with
which he had come to regard many of Benzeor's
actions had increased his feeling of discontent,
for Tom's sympathies were all with
the colonies in their struggle.</p>

<p>Many a time had he and Peter talked over
the matter, and the eagerness of one to serve
in the army was fully shared by the other.
But Benzeor's patriotism seemed all to be
dormant, and as the troubles increased, his
zeal to make money steadily increased also.
At times he would be absent from home for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
days together, and more than once Tom had
been awakened in the night by the sound
of strange voices heard in conversation with
Benzeor in the room beneath that in which
he was sleeping.</p>

<p>Thoughts of all these things had been in
Tom's mind throughout that voyage to New
York, and they, as well as his youthfulness,
served to explain the silence he had maintained
since he had set sail. He had known,
however, that Peter was to serve as the lookout
that day, and when he volunteered the
information it was the first time he had spoken
aloud for a half hour.</p>

<p>The rain now was steadily increasing, and
the uneasiness of the men on board the little
boat became more marked. They were far
from the tree by this time, and no one appeared
to know just what plan to follow.</p>

<p>"If I was alone, I'd take all the risks,"
said Benzeor at last.</p>

<p>"You needn't stop on our account," replied
Jacob. "I don't believe there's much
danger in starting up the river, any way, for
my part. Little Peter may not have seen
anything to amount to much. If you want
to chance it, go ahead."</p>

<p>"We don't just know what's ahead of us,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
said Barzilla uneasily. "It may be nothing,
and then again it may not be. I wish there
was some way of finding out before we risk
too much."</p>

<p>"Why not land farther down the shore and
let Tom go up and see?" said Jacob. "If
Little Peter's gone, it will mean the danger's
gone, too, and if he hasn't, why Tom here
can find out for us and report; though for
my part I'm not afraid to go up the river as
it is. It's too dark for any one to see us, or
it will be soon."</p>

<p>"That's a good suggestion," said Benzeor
quickly, as he brought the boat about.
"We'll land down the shore and let Tom go
up for us. You're not too much of a 'coward'
to do that, are you Tom?"</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Tom quietly, although his
cheeks flushed with anger at Benzeor's antiquated
and brutal pun. He had heard it
many times, but never without feeling angry,
although he well knew that Benzeor spoke the
words lightly.</p>

<p>With the change in the course the wind
seemed to increase. The spray was dashed
into their faces, and the men were soon
drenched. The sail had been shortened, but
the little boat dashed ahead with ever increasing
speed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a rough night outside," said Benzeor,
when at last he gained the desired point
on the shore. "It's lucky for us we're inside
the Hook. Now then, Tom!" he added.
"Bestir yourself, lad, and come back soon."</p>

<p>Tom leaped ashore and ran swiftly along
the beach toward the tree. He was familiar
with its location and knew that he could find
it in the darkest night. The rain beat upon
him and the darkness momentarily increased,
but the wind was with him, and in a brief
time he recognized the dim outlines of the
tree.</p>

<p>Then ceasing to run, he began to approach
more cautiously. He was not positive that
Peter was there now, for some one might
have taken his place. Certainly caution was
the better part in any event.</p>

<p>He stopped and whistled the half dozen
notes which he and Peter used as a call. He
waited a moment, but as no answer was heard
he advanced a little nearer and whistled
again.</p>

<p>"That you, Tom?" came from some one
in the tree.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tom.</p>

<p>In a moment Peter dropped from his position,
and began to explain to his friend the
cause of the display of the signal of danger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MEETING ON THE RIVER</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I've</span> been here since noon," began Peter,
"but it seems more like a whole day to me.
I've listened to the calls of the sea-birds and
heard the roar of the storm which I knew
was coming, till it almost seemed to me I
couldn't bear it any longer. I'm glad you've
come, for I've got a chance to stretch now,
and the sound of a voice will help to quiet
my nerves again."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you had any nerves," replied
Tom. "But we can't stand here in this
storm talking about such things. Benzeor
sent me over to find out what you meant by
hanging out the white flag. You haven't
seen anything suspicious, have you?"</p>

<p>"I have that," said Peter eagerly. "I was
beginning to think that my coming here was
all a piece of foolishness, when along about
four o'clock&mdash;leastwise I should think it was
about that time, though I didn't have any
dial anywhere about to mark the time for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
me&mdash;what should I see but a whaleboat making
for the river? You had better believe I
forgot all about the time and everything else
but the boat then, for I didn't know but
some more of the Greens were coming up the
Navesink on another trip such as they made
the other day."</p>

<p>Peter referred to an expedition which a
band of several hundred tories from New Jersey,
commonly known as the "Greens," had
made a few weeks before this time. They
had set forth from New York and had made
a visit to some of their former neighbors and
friends, and the tokens of their affection
which they had left behind them had chiefly
consisted of the ashes of burned homes and
empty barns. The raid had been a cruel
one, and its object apparently was more for
devastation than for plunder, and many of
the good people of Red Bank and Middletown
and the adjoining towns had good cause
to remember it so long as they lived. The
numbers of the invaders had rendered them
safe from all attacks, and the wanton destruction
they wrought before they returned to
New York had been the chief reason for keeping
a watch stationed in the old tree every
day since their visit. And Peter had received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
strict orders not to depart from his place of
observation, if he saw anything suspicious,
until he was satisfied that all danger was
past. And Peter was faithful, that was well
known, or he would not have been selected
for the duty that day.</p>

<p>"Well," resumed Peter, "I watched the
boat till it went out of sight up the river.
There were seven men on board of her, six
of 'em pulling at the oars and the seventh
steering. No more boats followed her, and
I shouldn't have been suspicious if I hadn't
thought I recognized the man who was steering."</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"He looked to me a good deal like Fenton."</p>

<p>"What? The pine robber?"</p>

<p>"Yes, though of course I may have been
mistaken. I never saw him but once and that
was when he was a blacksmith over by the
Court House before the war. My father had
sent me over there to have one of the horses
shod at his shop. I don't know that I should
have remembered him if it hadn't been for
something he did that day. I saw him take a
half-inch bar of iron and bend it almost double
with his hands. That made a great impression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
upon me, for I didn't believe there was another
man in the colony who could do that."</p>

<p>"Probably not," replied Tom. "But what
made you think this was one of Fenton's
whaleboats?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but Fenton himself. Of course
I've heard of the stories of what he's been
doing since he became a pine robber. His
gang is one of the worst, you know, and the
minute I set my two eyes on him I suspected
it was Fenton himself."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you get word up the river as
soon as you saw him?"</p>

<p>"They've got watchers farther up, and
that's their business. Besides, I didn't care
to have him double me up the way he did that
iron bar. Then, my business was to stay
here and give the warning to anybody that
might be going up the stream, you see.
That's why I waved the flag when I saw you
coming."</p>

<p>"And they haven't come back yet?" inquired
Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>"No. That's what I'm waiting for. There
isn't any fun in hanging out here in the wet,
I can tell you. Just as soon as I can see that
whaleboat coming out into the bay again
I'm done."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Peter, I'll go right back and
report to Benzeor. Maybe he'll take you on
board and carry you home."</p>

<p>"Not unless I see the whaleboat again,"
said Peter doggedly as he prepared to climb
to his seat in the tree again.</p>

<p>Tom hurriedly departed and started to return
with his message to the waiting Benzeor
and his men, who he knew would be becoming
impatient by this time. As he ran along
the beach the storm smote him full in the
face, but in spite of the driving rain the night
was not very dark. The moon was near the
full and gave sufficient light to enable him to
see far out over the tossing waters. He could
even discern the outlines of the little boat far
up the shore, and as he ran swiftly forward
he was thinking of the report he was to make
to the waiting Benzeor, and his thoughts were
not entirely pleasing.</p>

<p>Fenton's deeds had become notorious in
Old Monmouth. At the head of his brutal
band, composed of men as desperate and
reckless as he, he had pillaged and plundered
throughout the county during the preceding
year, and up to this time no one had been
found strong enough to put a stop to his evil
deeds. Any unprotected farmhouse was liable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to receive one of his visits, and such a visit
was seldom made without profit to the outlaws,
for such in fact they were, and with
their ill-gotten gains they hastened away to
store them in their hiding-places among the
pines.</p>

<p>Nor was Fenton's band the only one which
had its headquarters in that lonely and unfrequented
region known in Old Monmouth as
the "Pines." West, Disbrow, Fagan, Davenport,
and many others of the lawless men,
had engaged in similar occupations, and all
had their hiding-places in the same wild spot,
and in a measure protected and aided one
another.</p>

<p>Up to this time Fagan had been the only
one to suffer the well-deserved penalty of his
crimes, and in the preceding winter a band of
two hundred of the desperate patriots had assembled
and driven the famous, or rather infamous,
outlaw to bay. At last he had been
taken, and the infuriated men, mindful not
only of the sufferings of their own families at
his hands, but also of their possible future
sufferings as well, had measured out a stern
justice to the man, and with their own hands
had hanged him from the long limb of a tree
which stood by the side of the road which led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
from Monmouth Court House<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to Trenton.
Afterwards some of the patriots who had suffered
most from his evil deeds had severed the
skull from the body and nailed it to the tree,
and then, placing the pipe between the grinning
jaws, had left the uncanny sight as a
warning to all who might be disposed to follow
in the footsteps of the outlaw.</p>

<p>For a few weeks the suffering patriots
found relief, but only for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Despite the terrible warning, the other
bands of pine robbers soon renewed their labors,
and now in the early summer of '78 the
region was suffering more from the marauding
bands than ever had been known before.</p>

<p>It was all a part of the horrors of war.
Sometimes, when we read of the brave deeds
which have made famous some of the men
who had a share in the struggle, we are prone
to think only of the heroism displayed. And
there was many a true hero in that and in
every other war which our country has waged.
We are never to forget that; but there was
another side which has, to a large extent,
passed from the memory of the present generation.
The loss of property and of life,
the sufferings of the women and children in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the lonely homes, the barbarity and cruelty
of evil men who, freed from the restraint of
law in a time when the worst passions of men
were aroused, gave free rein to their avarice
and all that was bad in them, have frequently
been ignored or forgotten. The glory of war
or the pride in true heroism cannot entirely
atone for the sufferings that were only too
common in the scattered homes or lonely
places.</p>

<p>And Fenton's band was one of the worst.
From their strongholds among the pines, into
which few men had the hardihood to enter,
they would set forth on horseback some dark
night, and the tale they might have told upon
their return was ever one of blood and sorrow.
People tortured until in their agony they were
compelled to yield up their scanty savings,
raids upon the flocks and herds already becoming
far too small for the necessities of
their owners, burning houses, and men and
women deliberately shot by the outlaws, were
only a few among the many results of their
raids.</p>

<p>Not the least of the evils was the knowledge
that among the people of Monmouth
there were some who, while they might not
openly be known as members of the bands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
still gave the desired information to the leaders
as to the places where possessions were
secreted, or of the times when the patriots
were aroused and it was best for the "Barons
of the Pines," as some termed them, to remain
in hiding among the tall dark trees. Professedly,
the outlaws acknowledged no allegiance
to either side in the struggle, but somehow
it had come to pass that a stanch whig was
liable to suffer far more from their depredations
than his tory neighbor, and as a natural
consequence the feeling between neighbors
and those who had been friends was becoming
more and more strained and bitter.</p>

<p>Thoughts of these things were passing
rapidly through Tom's mind as he ran swiftly
on through the storm to rejoin his companions.
Fenton? Yes, he had heard of him too
many times not to recognize his name and to
feel well assured that a visit from him in such
a night could promise little good for any of
the patriots dwelling near the Navesink.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, Tom?" said Benzeor,
as the panting lad rejoined them. "Is it
Little Peter on the lookout? He must have
seen a ghost to have warned us to stay out
here in the bay in such a night as this. I'm
wet to the skin."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's Fenton," replied Tom huskily, for he
had not yet recovered his breath. "Peter
said he saw him and six of his men go up
the Navesink about four o'clock."</p>

<p>"Fenton?" said Jacob quickly. "Then
we're in for a night of it. We don't want
to fall into the hands of that pine robber
when our pockets are as well lined as they
are to-night."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about that," replied Benzeor
slowly. "There's ten chances to one
that they won't come back before morning,
and if they do they won't be likely to find us
in such a storm as this."</p>

<p>As he spoke a fresh gust swept the rain
directly into their faces. The storm certainly
was increasing, and the prospect of spending
a night in the bay was dreary enough to
cause the most stout-hearted to hesitate. And
it may have been that other thoughts than
that of the storm influenced Benzeor.</p>

<p>At any rate he gruffly responded, "You
can do as you please, but I'm going up the
Navesink. If you're afraid, you can stay
here or start out across the country on foot.
You'll have to speak quick if you go with
me, for I'm off."</p>

<p>Benzeor turned and grasped the bow of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
his boat to push her off the beach upon which
she had grounded. Before he had succeeded,
however, Jacob spoke up quickly and said,
"We're with you, Benzeor. If you can stand
it, we can."</p>

<p>"Get aboard then, every one of you!"
said Benzeor gruffly.</p>

<p>Tom and Barzilla quickly took their places
in the stern, while Benzeor, with the aid of
Jacob, soon sent the boat out from the shore.</p>

<p>The sail was soon rigged and shortened,
and the little party then started for the narrow
mouth of the Navesink. The boat rolled
and pitched in the storm, but Benzeor had
her well in hand, and soon steered into the
more quiet waters of the river. Tom could
see the tree as they passed, and was positive
that Peter could also see them, but no hail
was given, and the point was soon left far
behind them.</p>

<p>Then up the narrower waters of the river
the boat sped on in her course, but not a
word was spoken by any of those on board.
The storm was still raging and Benzeor's
attention was largely occupied in managing
his craft, and the others were busied with
thoughts which perhaps they did not care to
express.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom was decidedly anxious. A meeting
with Fenton and his band was something of
which he was fearful, and as they sped on his
fears increased each moment. Benzeor's apparent
indifference had not deceived him, and
deep in his heart there was a lurking suspicion
that perhaps he might be able to account for
it, if he felt so disposed.</p>

<p>However, he too was silent, and a half hour
had passed and as yet no signs of danger had
appeared. Benzeor was steering as close inshore
as the wind permitted, and Tom was
beginning to hope that they would succeed
in making their way up the river without
being discovered.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jacob, who was seated in the bow
and was keeping a constant lookout ahead,
shouted, "Port! Port your helm, Benzeor!
Quick! Quick!"</p>

<p>Benzeor instantly heeded the warning, but
his quick movement barely served to enable
them to pass a boat which loomed up in the
darkness. It was a whaleboat, and with a
sinking heart Tom saw that there were six
men rowing, while a seventh was seated in the
stern and was serving as helmsman.</p>

<p>Instantly Peter's words flashed into his
mind, and he knew that they had barely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
escaped a collision with the very boat which
the lookout had discovered making its way
up the Navesink late in the afternoon. The
party could be none other than that of Fenton
and his outlaw band.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BENZEOR'S VISITOR</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hold</span> on there! Hold on, I say! Stop,
or we'll shoot!"</p>

<p>The words were shouted by some one in
the whaleboat, and Benzeor evidently was
about to heed the sharp command. He
quickly changed the course of the boat, and
as the shortened sail flapped in the wind as
the little craft came about, the whaleboat
came alongside and some one reached forth
with a boat-hook, and the progress was instantly
stayed.</p>

<p>Tom's heart was beating rapidly in his excitement.
A wild impulse to leap into the
river seized him, but before he could leave
his position in the bow, two of the other
crew clambered on board, and he knew that
an attempt to escape would now be useless.
Doubtless the men were armed, and the darkness
was not deep enough to conceal him
from their sight. His only hope now depended
upon the actions of the men and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
course which Benzeor should decide to follow.</p>

<p>The sail was instantly lowered in obedience
to the sharp command of the men who had
boarded the boat, and, in great fear, the lad
waited for the purpose of their captors to be
declared. He drew back in his position in
the bow, hoping to escape the notice of all
on board, as he saw that Benzeor had arisen
from his seat and stood facing the men.</p>

<p>"Who are you? What ye out in a night
like this for? Whose boat is this?" exclaimed
the one who appeared to be the
leader.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Fenton?" replied Benzeor
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Ho, it's Benzeor Osburn!" exclaimed
the man, peering intently into the face before
him as he spoke. "I thought it was strange
we didn't find you in your house. We waited
an hour as we agreed to, but when you didn't
put in an appearance, we thought we'd start
back. Where ye been, Benzeor? What's
up now?"</p>

<p>"I'd been back home in time if it hadn't
been for the storm and an alarm we had back
in the bay. I think ye'd better go back
with me now, Fenton. I've got some facts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that may interest you, and we can't talk them
over here."</p>

<p>"Who are these men with you?" inquired
Fenton suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're all right. I'll vouch for
them, every one," replied Benzeor. "You
haven't anything to fear from any of my
friends. Come up to my house and I'll tell
ye all about it."</p>

<p>Fenton hesitated a moment before he replied,
and Tom peered intently at the man of
whom he had already heard so many tales.
He could see his great form, although he
could not distinguish the features of his face
in the darkness. His deep voice and gruff
manner had not tended to allay the lad's fears,
and now Benzeor's words and actions filled
his heart with a new alarm. Was Benzeor
about to cast in his lot with Fenton? His
words betrayed the fact of their previous
acquaintance, and all the recent suspicious
actions of his foster father came back to him.
No one in the party had yet spoken, except
Benzeor and Fenton, but the recent conversation
on board the boat, much of which Tom
had overheard, convinced the troubled lad
that no very strong protest would be made
against any proposal that Benzeor might feel
disposed to make.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm rather of the opinion," said Fenton
roughly, "that it's about time you went
home with me. I don't know who these
fellows on board here are, and I don't care.
You're the one I'm after, Benzeor, and it
seems to me the time's come for you to join
us or quit. You've been shilly-shallying
long enough."</p>

<p>"Hush! Don't speak so loud!" replied
Benzeor anxiously.</p>

<p>Fenton laughed outright at Benzeor's evident
alarm, and, turning to his companions
in the whaleboat, said, "I think we'd better
take the boat along with us. We can land
this crew anywhere along the shore, or we
can sink 'em in the river, just which you
please. It's too much of a storm for us to
be hanging around here on the Navesink."</p>

<p>"Fenton," said Benzeor, rising and stepping
up to the side of the outlaw, "you'd
better do as I say. I've got something to
tell ye, and it's worth hearing, too."</p>

<p>A low conversation followed between the
two men which Tom, with all his efforts, was
not able to hear. The result of it, however,
quickly became apparent when Fenton turned
to his companions and said, "It's all right,
boys. You go on without me, and I'll join<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
you to-morrow. I'm going up to Benzeor's
now."</p>

<p>The boat-hook was quickly withdrawn at
his command, and the sound of the oars of
the departing boat soon ceased to be heard.</p>

<p>The sail of Benzeor's boat was then hoisted
again, and once more the little party, increased
now by the addition of Fenton, began
to make their way up the Navesink. Though
the rain was steadily falling, the wind was
favoring, and the boat, handled by the skillful
Benzeor, held steadily to its way. The low
shores could be seen in the distance on either
side, and an occasional light betrayed the
location of some lonely farmhouse, whose
occupants in the confidence begotten of the
storm had ventured to sit up till a later hour
than was customary in those days.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken on board the boat,
and Fenton had taken a position near Tom
from which he did not move. All were
drenched, but a summer rain was something
which none of them minded in such a time
as that.</p>

<p>When an hour had passed, Benzeor ran
his boat closer inshore and in a few moments
landed. Then turning to his companions he
said, "Come over to my house to-morrow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Jacob, and I'll give you and Barzilla your
shares of the money."</p>

<p>"We'll go with you now," replied Jacob,
evidently not desiring to put off the day of
reckoning too long, a desire in which Barzilla
also shared.</p>

<p>"No, I can't fix it up to-night. You can
take the bag, though, if you want to, and
bring me my share to-morrow."</p>

<p>Benzeor's confidence in his fellows served
the desired purpose, and Jacob and Barzilla
speedily departed, taking with them the little
bag of gold which had been received as the
price of the produce they had taken to New
York.</p>

<p>"Tom, you look out for the boat," called
Benzeor, as he and Fenton started towards
the little house whose outlines could be discerned
in the distance.</p>

<p>Tom obeyed, and as he worked over the
little boat, looking well to all the details, his
thoughts were far more busy than his hands.
The changes which he had noted in Benzeor
of late seemed almost to have reached their
climax. Was the man intending now to go
with Fenton? All his recent absences from
home came up before the lad's mind, and the
strange visitors he had received there of late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
were not forgotten. What was it Benzeor
was planning to do? He was not much like
the man he had been a few years before
this time, and as Tom thought over all the
changes, he was troubled more and more.</p>

<p>He knew that Sarah had not been unaware
of what was going on, for many a time had
they talked it all over together. Sarah had
remained a steadfast champion of her father,
but Tom had not failed to see that she was
none the less troubled by his strange actions.
His grasping disposition had become more
and more apparent of late, and while he had
never in the presence of his family referred
to anything he had in his mind to do against
the patriots, his very silence in such times
was more threatening than any words he could
utter. But Sarah had steadily refused to
believe that her father would desert the cause
for which at the outbreak of the war he had
professed the most ardent attachment; still,
it was impossible for her not to discover, what
Tom for a long time had seen, that he was
strangely silent of late.</p>

<p>The change in Benzeor Osburn had been
so gradual as to deceive many of his friends
and neighbors. All had known his "closeness,"
as the country people termed his love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of money, but few of them had thought it
would ever lead him into the position in
which the man at that time really stood.</p>

<p>Benzeor in '76 had been among the loudest
in his expressions of loyalty to the cause
of the colonies, and had been foremost in
blaming his own brother for his "toryism."
His brother's property had been confiscated,
but Benzeor's had been left unmolested, so
confident had all the whigs been in the sincerity
of his expressions. And at the time
Benzeor had meant what he said, and said
what he meant. But never for a moment
had he dreamed that the struggle would be
such a long-continued one as it had proved
to be, nor had he thought that patriotism
would affect his own possessions. All that
would be done would be to make a strong
protest against the unjust taxation, for Benzeor
had hated taxes as he did few things in
this world, and then a compromise would be
effected, which would permit the colonists to
go on with their occupations, and the mother
country would soon see that it was not to her
own advantage to drive her rebellious children
too far.</p>

<p>The first shock had come to him when the
Continental Congress had declared the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to be a free and independent nation.
That was going too far, Benzeor thought,
and so he freely expressed himself; but still
hoping that a compromise of some kind would
be made, and that his own possessions would
not be disturbed, he had uttered no further
protests, though his voice ceased to be heard
in favor of the rebellion.</p>

<p>As further events betrayed the weakness of
the patriot cause, and he had found that
patriotism was likely to prove a somewhat
expensive virtue, his feelings had undergone
a still more decided change. At first
he had entered into one or two secret projects
by which he had succeeded in enriching
his own pockets, and the success had so affected
him that as his patriotism decreased
his hopes of gains correspondingly increased;
and soon from deeds for which he tried to
justify himself, he had been gradually drawn
into others which even his own seared conscience
proclaimed to be wrong. In some of
the latter he had come into contact with the
outlaws of Fenton's class, and his association
with them had soon banished the feeling of
disgust he had formerly cherished for them,
until it had even come to pass that Fenton
himself was a not unwelcome guest in his
own home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the visits had been made secretly,
and the promises of rich harvests to be reaped,
as the result of their evil deeds, had appealed
to Benzeor more strongly than even he himself
was aware. The lawless times, the constant
turmoils, the bitterness between those
who had recently been the warmest of friends,
the ease with which raids were made, and the
apparent impossibility of detection, had all
combined to arouse the avaricious Benzeor
more and more; and now not very much was
needed to draw him still farther within the
toils of Fenton and his band.</p>

<p>Not all of these things were apparent to
Tom when at last he left the boat and started
towards the house, but he had seen sufficient
to make him suspicious of Benzeor, and he
was as perplexed as he was troubled. All
his own feelings had gone out more and more
to the patriot cause, and more than once had
he been sadly tempted to depart from his
home without waiting for the formality of
buying up his time, and he had even gone so
far as to suggest to Sarah several times what
he had it in his mind to do. Sarah's grief,
however, and the confidence which she still
professed to feel in her father, as well as the
dislike in his own heart to do anything which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
bore any resemblance to stealing,&mdash;for so the
troubled lad regarded the taking of time
which did not really belong to him as the
bound boy of Benzeor Osburn,&mdash;had hitherto
held him back. How long such feelings
would continue to sway him Tom could not
decide when at last he lifted the latch and
entered the kitchen.</p>

<p>Benzeor and his guest were seated before
the fire which had been started in the wide
and open fireplace, and were drying their wet
clothing as they conversed eagerly together.</p>

<p>As Tom came in, Benzeor glanced up
hastily and said, "You can go to bed, Tom.
You must be wet and tired, and there is a lot
of work to be done to-morrow." Benzeor's
voice was not unkind, but Tom did not fail
to see that his presence was not desired. He
quickly lighted a candle with a splinter which
he thrust into the fire and held until it was
in a flame, and then went up the low stairway
to his room directly over the kitchen in which
the men were seated.</p>

<p>As he entered the room he noted the
gleam which came through the open space
near the rude chimney, and, placing the candle
on the low table, he advanced and peered
down at the men. He could see both plainly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and, after observing them for a moment, he
was about to turn away and take off his dripping
clothing, when he suddenly stopped.
He had overheard a word which caused his
heart to beat much more rapidly, and in a
moment he was upon his knees striving to
hear what more would be said.</p>

<p>He remained in the same position for an
hour, and at last arose only when Fenton
opened the door and went out into the darkness.
Then Benzeor closed and barred the
door, and started directly up the stairway.</p>

<p>Instantly Tom blew out his candle and
leaped into bed, all wet and muddy as he was,
and drew the bedclothes close up around his
face.</p>

<p>Benzeor came slowly on and then stopped
before the door of Tom's room. The lad
was trembling in his excitement, for he well
knew that if the man should enter and discover
that he had not removed his clothing
before going to bed, his suspicions would
at once be aroused. And above all things
Benzeor's suspicion at that time was what
Tom most desired to lull.</p>

<p>There were wild thoughts in Tom's mind of
leaping from the bed and, rushing past the
man, making a break for the outside. Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the man might not enter, however, and,
trembling with fear and excitement, Tom
waited.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that a long time had
elapsed, and still no sound outside the door
could be heard. Had Benzeor gone on? The
light of his candle which still shone through
the cracks disproved that. What could he
then be doing?</p>

<p>Tom tried to conjecture what must be
going on on the stairway, but the silence was
still unbroken. The minutes were like hours
to the frightened lad. It seemed to him as
if the beatings of his heart must be heard
throughout the house.</p>

<p>His suspense was soon ended&mdash;when Benzeor
lifted the latch and Tom felt the light
of the candle streaming in full upon his face.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MESSENGER</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment Tom closed his eyes and
waited for the words which he expected and
feared to hear. His body was trembling and
all his strength was required to prevent his
teeth from chattering. If Benzeor should
enter the room Tom knew that at once his
predicament would be discovered, and in the
present state of his foster father's feelings he
was aware that he could expect no mercy at
his hands.</p>

<p>He heard no footstep, but he felt that the
light of the candle was still shining upon his
face and knew that Benzeor had not departed.
At last, unable to bear the suspense longer, he
opened his eyes, for he felt that he must see
what was going on in the room. There stood
Benzeor in the doorway holding the candle
with one hand, and intently regarding the
apparently sleeping boy before him.</p>

<p>"I'll be down directly," said Tom drowsily,
as if he were just awaking. "I didn't know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
it was time to get up. I'll be with you in a
minute."</p>

<p>"It isn't time to get up," replied Benzeor
slowly. "I'm just going to bed. I stopped
to see if you were all right. Have you been
asleep long?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. Is there anything
wrong?" Tom still kept the bedclothes drawn
tightly about his face, and although he was
feigning that he had been sleeping, he was in
a state of terror. If Benzeor should approach
the bed he well knew what would follow.</p>

<p>"No, there's nothing wrong," replied Benzeor.
"I just wanted to see if you were all
right. It's been a hard trip, and there's
much work to be done to-morrow."</p>

<p>Tom closed his eyes and did not continue
the conversation, hoping that the man would
feel satisfied and leave him to himself. Nor
was he disappointed, for Benzeor soon withdrew
and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Tom could hear him as he stumbled about
in the adjoining room, preparing for bed.
Frightened as the lad had been, he had not
failed to notice the expression upon Benzeor's
face. It seemed to him that fear and recklessness
were combined there, and that in the
recent decision which the man had made, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
had bidden farewell to everything good in
his nature.</p>

<p>Benzeor had not been without his good
qualities. Even then, in spite of his alarm,
Tom recalled his rough kindnesses, and
thought how much better in many ways his
foster father had treated him than had some
of the true fathers treated their own sons, for
the times were rough and the one thing which
was demanded of all the growing boys was
implicit obedience to their elders. And this
obedience had been ofttimes compelled by no
gentle means. The use of the strap upon
boys who were as large as their fathers was
not unknown, and no one ever thought of
resenting the harsh treatment. But Benzeor
had seldom struck him. Tom almost wished
that he had, for it would make the carrying
out of the project he had already formed
much easier.</p>

<p>Then, too, all the kindness he had received
at the hands of Benzeor's wife and
of the girls came back to him. It was true
that this had been largely of a negative character,
but in times like these through which
the troubled lad was then passing, even that
was not forgotten. He had toiled early and
late, and knew that he had given more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
a full equivalent for the scanty food and
rough clothing he had received. But after
all, Benzeor's home had been all the home he
had ever known, and he was not unmindful
of the benefits he had received.</p>

<p>His soul now, however, was in a state of
turmoil. The words he had overheard had
proved conclusively that Benzeor was a
changed man, and as Tom thought of the
project which Fenton had presented, and into
which his foster father had entered with apparent
eagerness, his own indignation increased.
The long waiting was past now,
and the time for action, the time of which he
had dreamed and thought so much of late,
had come at last.</p>

<p>He removed the bed-clothing and sat up
on the side of the bed, listening intently.
Benzeor had ceased to move about in his
room, and the sounds which now came indicated
clearly that he was asleep. Against
the little window the rain was still beating,
and the darkness was so intense in the room
that Tom could not distinguish any object.</p>

<p>For several minutes he continued in his
position, undecided whether he had better
make the attempt to depart from the house
by the way of the stairs, or through the window<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in his room. If he should select the
former, the stairs would be sure to creak
under his feet; and then, too, there would be
the bars which must be drawn from the door.
There were too many possibilities of detection
to make that method of departure the
desirable one.</p>

<p>If he should go through the window, all
he would have to do would be to drop upon
the woodpile directly beneath,&mdash;a pile which
Tom knew was there, for he himself had
drawn and cut the wood only a few days before
this time. He decided to use the window.</p>

<p>Stepping slowly and carefully, he approached
and quietly raised the sash. As he
looked out into the night, the farm buildings
could be seen, and yonder was the road he
was to seek.</p>

<p>Hesitating no longer, the resolute boy
crawled through the open window, and then,
clinging for a moment to the sash with his
hands, dropped upon the woodpile below.
There was a noise as the wood rolled from
under him, but, quickly rising, he ran to the
long lane which led out to the road, and
then stopped to learn whether his departure
had been discovered or not.</p>

<p>The silence was unbroken. The outlines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the rude little house stood out in the darkness,
the rain was falling steadily, and the
heavy clouds hung low over the earth. Not
even the dog had been disturbed, and with a
lighter heart Tom turned and ran down the
lane and was soon in the road.</p>

<p>The mud was now thick and heavy, and
he found his progress difficult. But as he
had not far to go, he ran steadily on, and
soon came within sight of Little Peter's house.
There was no light to be seen within it, and
he was not at all certain that his friend had
returned.</p>

<p>He approached and stood beneath the window
of the boy's room, which, like his own,
was over the kitchen. Then he gave the low
whistle which they both had used as a "call."
At first there was no response, and when he
had given it two or three times he concluded
that his friend had not returned from his
work as the lookout in the tree by the mouth
of the Navesink. Nothing then remained to
be done but to rouse the family, for Tom was
determined, and was well aware that what he
planned to do must be done quickly.</p>

<p>Approaching the kitchen door he rapped
loudly upon it. Twice had he repeated the
summons before a window was raised, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
some one looking out upon him called,
"Who's there? Is that you, Peter?"</p>

<p>"No, it's not Peter. It's Tom Coward,
and I want to get in. I've got something to
tell you."</p>

<p>"I'll be down in a moment," said Peter's
mother, for Tom had recognized the voice as
her's.</p>

<p>Tom soon heard the heavy bars withdrawn,
and in a brief time the door was opened,
and then closed and carefully barred behind
him.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Tom?" inquired the
woman anxiously. "Has anything happened
to Peter?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied Tom. "He
was all right when I left him a few hours
ago down by the Hook. But what I want to
know now is whether you've had any word
from his father?"</p>

<p>"Not a word, except that it's reported the
army's on the march again. Why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I ought to tell you,"
replied Tom hesitatingly, "but the truth of
the matter is that I happened to hear that he
was coming home."</p>

<p>"You've heard something more than that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Tom Coward," said the woman now thoroughly
alarmed. "I know you've heard
more, or you wouldn't have come over here
at this time of night and in such a storm.
What is it? What is it?"</p>

<p>Tom perceived that he had gone too far to
retreat now, and so he began his story. He
did not go into all the details, for as yet he
did not desire to implicate Benzeor, at least
in the eyes of all his neighbors.</p>

<p>"The way of it is this," began Tom hesitatingly.
"I happened to be to-night where
I overheard the talk between two men, and
one of 'em was Fenton, the pine robber."</p>

<p>Tom could perceive the expression of alarm
which swept over the face of the woman, who
was still standing before him. Apparently
ignoring it, however, he went on. "It seems
that both of the armies are on the march
across Jersey, and that Washington has halted
over by Hopewell. Somehow, Fenton had
got word that your husband was coming
home for a day, and he's fixed up a plan to
trap and take him."</p>

<p>"I haven't heard a word," said the woman
slowly. "When was he coming?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"And Fenton knows of it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. And he knows something more,
too, or at least he pretends to. I heard him
say that you had some money hidden in an
old sock, which you'd stored away in the
garret."</p>

<p>Tom saw the woman start at his words,
and knew then that Fenton's statement had
been correct, although he could not conjecture
how the pine robber had received his
information. Little Peter's mother was a
resolute woman, but even the stoutest heart
might well be alarmed to hear that Fenton
was aware of such possessions.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea when Little Peter
will come home?"</p>

<p>"No. It's too bad to keep him out in
such a night. And we need him here now."</p>

<p>"I'll wait till he comes," said Tom quietly.
"There's no danger to-night, but I want to
see him, and I don't think you'll object to
my staying, will you?"</p>

<p>"No," said the woman eagerly. "Oh,
what times these are! My husband has been
in the army more than a year, and the end
hasn't come yet. What will become of us?
What shall we do? Tom," she added suddenly,
"what was Fenton going to do with
him if he caught him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take him and send him to New York.
You know there's a reward for every prisoner
taken. But he hasn't got him yet."</p>

<p>"No, that's so; and what's more he won't
either, if it can be prevented. Have you told
Benzeor about it? Hark! There's some
one at the door now!"</p>

<p>The woman was not mistaken, for a low
tapping on the kitchen door could be distinctly
heard. For a moment neither spoke,
but they could not conceal their fears from
each other. Just then a stronger gust of
wind drove the rain with added force against
the windows. The sound of the storm seemed
to increase the fear of those within the house.
Perhaps Fenton himself had even then come;
or, as was more probable, Tom thought, his
own departure had been discovered, and Benzeor
had come for him. As between the two,
Tom decidedly preferred to meet Fenton at
that time.</p>

<p>Again the low rapping was heard, and
Tom knew that some response must be made.
"I'll open the door. Maybe it's Little
Peter come back," he whispered.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't Peter. He wouldn't come
in that way."</p>

<p>"I'll find out who it is," replied Tom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
more resolutely, although his heart was oppressed
by a great fear. His hands were
trembling, and he almost expected that the
moment he drew back the bars a rush against
the door would be made.</p>

<p>"You stand ready to push against the
door," he said as he grasped the bar. Slowly
he drew it back, and standing away from the
slight opening called out, "Who's there?"</p>

<p>No reply was heard, and the wind which
swept through the open space quickly extinguished
the candle, leaving them both in
total darkness. For a moment Tom thought
they were being attacked, and he instantly
slammed the door back, and shot the bar into
its place.</p>

<p>The rapping upon the door was quickly
repeated, and the voice of some one outside
could be heard. "Don't light the candle
again," whispered Tom. "It'll let them see
what's inside here. Who's out there?"
he called in louder tones. "Who's there?
You'll have to tell who you are, or we shan't
let you in. Who is it?"</p>

<p>Another rap was the only reply, and Tom
was almost decided not to heed the summons
longer, but to leave the callers, whoever they
might be, out there in the storm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll go upstairs and look out of the window,"
whispered Peter's mother; and, creeping
softly out of the room, she soon made
her way up the stairway to the room overhead
from which she had replied to Tom's
own summons a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Tom waited and listened. The rapping
was not repeated, and no sound could be
heard outside the door. What could it all
mean? Had the marauders gone around to
some of the windows? These were barred by
heavy inside shutters, and no light could be
seen to reveal the presence of any one. The
darkness in the room was intense, and Tom
almost thought he could feel it. He was
breathing hard in his excitement, but he had
not left his position by the door.</p>

<p>Soon he heard the sound of the woman
returning down the stairway. He waited
breathlessly, and she soon rejoined him.</p>

<p>"I can't see but one man," she whispered.
"He's right there in front of the door."</p>

<p>"Is it Benzeor?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't see. You'd better open
the door and let him in. We can handle
one."</p>

<p>Tom did not feel so positive about that,
but bidding her light the candle, he again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
drew back the bar. "Come in! Come in!
Quick!" he called.</p>

<p>Some one pushed past him, and the door
was instantly closed and barred again.</p>

<p>The candle was not yet lighted, and in the
darkness he felt as if some one were about to
grasp him. He could almost feel hands upon
him now. He stepped farther back from
the door, and waited in breathless suspense
for the candle to be lighted.</p>

<p>After several attempts, the woman succeeded
in igniting a splinter from the embers
in the ashes on the fireplace, and the beams
of the lighted candle quickly dispelled the
darkness.</p>

<p>"It's Indian John!" said Tom with a
great sigh of relief as he saw the man before
him.</p>

<p>The visitor was a strange appearing being,
clad in the leggings and moccasins of his race,
while over his shoulders he wore a faded coat
which once had done duty for some Continental
soldier. His dark eyes burned as if
they had caught a reflection from the sputtering
candle, but with a countenance unmoved
he gazed quietly at his companions in the
room.</p>

<p>"Oh, John, what a fright you gave us!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
said the woman at last. "What brings you
here on a night like this?"</p>

<p>The Indian made no reply, save to draw a
letter from the pocket of the dripping, faded
coat, and quietly held it forth to the woman.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>IN THE TEN-ACRE LOT</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> Peter's mother instantly grasped
the letter, and seating herself by the table,
and drawing the candle nearer, at once began
to read. Tom watched her eagerly, but she
did not speak, and the expression upon her
face did not betray any of the emotions in
her heart.</p>

<p>The Indian still stood motionless in the
position he had taken when he first entered
the room, and except for the occasional turning
of his dark eyes from the boy to the
woman, so far as appearances went he might
have been a statue. The rain still dashed
against the windows, and the sounds of the
wind outside showed that the storm was
unabated. The flickering candle served to
intensify the darkness, and the alarm which
Tom had felt had not entirely departed.</p>

<p>The woman read the letter all through
carefully, and then, without a word of explanation,
began to read it again. Tom hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
knew what to do. He had given her his
warning, and whether she would care for his
further services he could not determine. He
did not feel like interrupting her, and yet he
feared that his presence now might not be
altogether welcome, for he had no means of
knowing what the message was, or who had
sent it.</p>

<p>His uncertainty was quickly dispelled, however,
as the woman laid the letter upon the
table, and turning to him said, "You were
right, Tom. Peter is coming home; but how
you found it out, I cannot even guess."</p>

<p>Tom did not feel at liberty to enlighten
her upon the subject beyond what he had
told her already, for he was sadly troubled
about Benzeor and his relations with Fenton.
Doubtless Benzeor was implicated, but matters
had not yet gone so far that he felt he
was at liberty to betray his foster father to
the neighbors.</p>

<p>"Yes," resumed the woman, "Peter is
coming home, but only for a day or two."</p>

<p>"Where is he? What does he say of the
army?" inquired Tom.</p>

<p>"Washington is at Hopewell, as you said,
Tom. When he found out that Clinton
really intended to march across Jersey, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
detached General Maxwell's brigade and some
of the militia to obstruct and bother the British,
and Peter was in the militia, you know.
They were to keep close to the redcoats, and
by their skirmishes keep them from going
too fast, and so give Washington a chance to
pass them, and then, when the place he wanted
was found, turn about and fight. When
the army crossed the Delaware at Coryell's
Ferry, Washington sent Colonel Morgan with
six hundred of the riflemen to reinforce Maxwell,
and with the rest of his men he set out
to march toward Princeton."</p>

<p>"I thought you said he was at Hopewell
now," said Tom.</p>

<p>"So he is, Peter writes, but Hopewell isn't
but a few miles from Princeton, you know,
and he decided to stop there and give his
army a good rest. Peter writes that all the
men now think that Clinton is marching so
slowly on purpose, and that his plan is to let
the Americans go on into the lower country
and then gain the right of our army by a
quick march and get possession of the higher
ground on the right of our men. Peter
writes that that is what all the Continentals
think Clinton is trying to do, and so General
Washington has halted at Hopewell. That's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
only five miles from Princeton, you see, and
he is going to stay there a few days so that
he can give his men a good rest before any
engagement takes place; and he can find out
what Clinton's plans are, too."</p>

<p>"And while the army is waiting there, Big
Peter thinks he'll run up home for a day,
does he?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just it. He's sent me word
of his coming by Indian John, here. But
you must have been delayed John," she said,
turning to the Indian as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Heap wet," said the Indian quietly.</p>

<p>"When does he say he expects to be
here?" inquired Tom.</p>

<p>"To-morrow; no, to-day, for it must be
long past midnight now. I shouldn't be
surprised to see him any time."</p>

<p>"Well I've given you my message, and
you'll know what to do now. I think perhaps
I'd better be going back home, that is,
unless there's something you think I can do
to help you."</p>

<p>"No, there's nothing more now, Tom.
Little Peter will soon be here, and with him
and Indian John in the house, I don't think
we shall have much to fear. It was good of
you to come, Tom. I shall never forget you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and I know that Peter will not, either. I am
sadly troubled, but I think it will be all
right."</p>

<p>"Good-night, then," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Good-night, and thank you again for all
your trouble and kindness."</p>

<p>Tom drew back the bar, and, opening the
door, passed out into the night, little dreaming
that he had looked upon the face of
Little Peter's mother for the last time.</p>

<p>As he ran along the lonesome road, he
could see that the clouds were breaking, and
in low masses were swept by the wind across
the sky. The rain had almost ceased now,
but the air was damp and heavy and strangely
oppressive. Perhaps it was the oppressiveness
which affected Tom more than the excitement
through which he had just passed,
for the lad was much depressed as he came
nearer to Benzeor's house. All the conversation
he had overheard between the men came
back to him, and he almost wished that he
had not left Peter's mother alone with Indian
John and the children. His feeling of obligation
to Benzeor had mostly departed now,
and as he recalled the plots of his foster
father his heart was hot within him. He
even thought of going over to the Court<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
House and reporting the matter to Sheriff
Forman that very night; but the hope that
Benzeor still might not join Fenton in the
evil project they had formed deterred him,
and as he just then obtained a glimpse of the
house which for more than ten years had
been the only home he had ever known, his
mind was recalled to his own immediate plans.
At least he had given Peter's mother the
warning, and if Fenton's band should make
the proposed visit, in any event she would be
prepared to receive them.</p>

<p>At first Tom thought he would not return
to his room, but would pass the night in the
barn; still the fear that Benzeor might discover
his absence, and be led to suspect
its cause, quickly presented itself, and the
troubled lad decided to go back to his accustomed
place.</p>

<p>Carefully he climbed up on the woodpile,
and grasping the sill drew himself up and
passed through the open window. He stood
for a moment in the room and listened intently.
Not a sound could be heard, and
even the long drawn-out snores with which
Benzeor had been wont to proclaim to the
household the fact that he had entered the
land of dreams were silent now. He waited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
several moments, and as the silence was still
unbroken he proceeded carefully to remove
his wet clothing, and climbed into his high
bed.</p>

<p>For the first time then he realized how
thoroughly tired he was. The bed had never
been more grateful to him, and a heavy sigh
of relief escaped his lips. He heard the
crowing of the cocks and knew that the
morning could not be far away now.</p>

<p>Not even the exciting events of the day,
or the treacherous project of Benzeor, or his
anxiety for the safety of Little Peter's father,
now availed to keep the wearied lad awake.</p>

<p>How long he slept he did not know, but it
was broad daylight when he opened his eyes.
Some one was pounding upon his door, and
with a confused thought that Fenton was
besieging the house, or that Washington had
begun an attack upon Clinton's forces, he
quickly sat up in the bed and listened.</p>

<p>The summons was repeated, and Tom at
once realized where he was and what was
expected of him. There was no mistaking
Benzeor's rude method of proclaiming the
presence of the morning, and if he had had
any doubts, they would have been quickly
dispelled by the words which followed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, Tom, get up! It's high time we
were at work again!"</p>

<p>"I'll be down in a minute," replied Tom
as he leaped out of bed and hastily dressed.</p>

<p>While he was engaged in that occupation
he tried desperately to collect his thoughts
and think of some way out of the troubles
which he feared were sure to come that day.
Should he tell Benzeor plainly that he could
no longer remain under his roof? Ought he
to tell him what he had overheard the night
before? Had the time come for him to declare
himself and to take the open stand
which he had for a long time secretly planned
to do? Thoughts of Sarah and the toiling,
careworn little mother of the household presented
themselves before his troubled mind,
and the longer he thought, the more perplexed
he became.</p>

<p>The problem was not solved when he passed
down the stairs and went out of the house to
the barrel which stood beneath the corner of
the eaves. He took the rude wooden bowl
and filled it with water, and desperately tried
to arrive at some conclusion as he bathed his
flushed face.</p>

<p>The family were already seated at the
breakfast-table, and the sounds of Benzeor's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
gruff voice could be distinctly heard through
the open windows. The hens with their
broods were moving about the yard, and the
dog came and rubbed against his leg as the
lad dried his face and hands on the rough
towel that was hanging near the water barrel.
The storm had passed, and the summer sun
was shining clear and strong now.</p>

<p>As he lifted his eyes and looked out over
Benzeor's fertile lands, only a vision of peace
and restfulness could be seen on every side.
It was all so different from the storm which
was in his own soul that Tom almost groaned
aloud as he turned to enter the kitchen and
take his accustomed place at the table.</p>

<p>As he entered the room, Benzeor said,
"You're late this morning, lad, but I thought
I would let you sleep, you had such a hard
day of it yesterday. But there's no trip to
New York this morning, and not likely to be
one again soon."</p>

<p>Benzeor's manner was not unkind, and as
Tom glanced at him he wondered whether
the man was in any wise suspicious of him
or not. Apparently he was not, but without
making any reply Tom seated himself and
quietly decided to wait until they were alone
before he spoke of what was in his mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tom," said Benzeor after a brief silence,
"I want you to go over to the ten-acre lot
to-day. The ground's wet, but the corn
there needs hoeing, and we can't wait."</p>

<p>The "ten-acre lot" was on the border of
Benzeor's possessions, and was nearly a mile
distant from the house. On all sides it was
bordered by woods, and was as lonely a place
as could be found in all the region.</p>

<p>"Are you going, too?" inquired Tom,
with an apparent indifference he was far
from feeling.</p>

<p>"No. I've got to go in another direction
to-day. I may not be back at night either,
though I can't say as to that. You'd better
take your dinner, too, Tom, and I'll leave
one of the muskets for you. You can load
it up with bird-shot and keep the blackbirds
and crows away. They're raising the mischief
this year, and corn's going to be worth
money this fall, if I'm not greatly mistaken."</p>

<p>Tom made no reply, although his heart
was beating a little more rapidly than usual.
Benzeor's absence from home promised little
good, and the words which he had overheard
the night before came back now with redoubled
force. Where was Benzeor going?
And why did he send him to work in the distant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
field, when he was positive that some of
the corn nearer the house was in far greater
need of hoeing than that in the ten-acre lot?</p>

<p>However, he did not voice his questions,
and immediately after the breakfast was over
Benzeor mounted his horse and departed up
the road, going in the opposite direction to
that which led to Little Peter's house.</p>

<p>Tom went up into the unfinished room in
which Benzeor kept his guns and ammunition,
but instead of taking the musket to
which the man had referred, he selected a
rifle, and loaded it with a ball instead of the
bird-shot as Benzeor had directed. Just why
he did this Tom could not have explained
even to himself, but somehow there was the
feeling in his heart that he might need to be
prepared to deal with larger game that day
than the thieving blackbirds or the noisy
crows.</p>

<p>"I've got your dinner all ready, Tom,"
said Sarah, as the boy came back with his
gun into the kitchen. "Why, you've got
the rifle!" she added in surprise, as she
noted the weapon he had in his hands.
"There's nothing wrong, is there?" she said
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I hope not. I don't know. I thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
I'd take this gun," replied Tom in some confusion.</p>

<p>Sarah said nothing more, but Tom knew
from her manner that she was alarmed. He
would have been glad to quiet her fears,
but the anxiety in his own heart rendered
him somewhat embarrassed, and without saying
anything more he shouldered his gun,
and picking up the little pail, or "blicky," as
the country people termed it, having adopted
the Dutch word whether they themselves
were Dutch or not, he set forth on his walk
to the distant ten-acre lot.</p>

<p>He stopped in the barn long enough to
select a hoe, and then with the added implement
resumed his journey across the fields.
When he came to the borders of the woods
through which he was to pass, he turned and
looked back at the house.</p>

<p>Sarah was still standing in the doorway,
and as she saw Tom stop she waved at him
the sunbonnet which she was holding in one
hand by the strings. Tom waved his "blicky"
by way of a return, and then entered the
woods, which shut out the view of all that
lay behind him.</p>

<p>The birds were flitting about in the trees
and filling the air with their songs. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
squirrels darted along the branches, stopping
only occasionally to chatter at the intruder.
High over all he could see a fish-hawk and
his mate circling in the air, and Tom knew
that their nest was not far away, and doubtless
they were watching him to see that he
did no harm to their little ones, which by this
time must be well grown.</p>

<p>As he came near to a marshy little pond
which lay in the centre of an open place in
the woods, he stopped for a moment when he
heard the angry notes of a ground thrush
near by. He soon saw that the bird was
engaged in a fierce contest with a water
snake which had crawled up the bank and
doubtless had been endeavoring to make his
breakfast upon the fledgelings in the nest he
had discovered.</p>

<p>Tom watched the contest for a moment,
and then advanced to the aid of the bird,
which was beating the ground with her wings,
and occasionally darting swiftly at her foe.
His approach was instantly seen by the snake,
which quickly abandoned the contest, and,
squirming down the bank, slid into the stagnant
water; but Tom could still see the head
which was lifted above the water, and the
glittering little eyes were intently watching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
his movements, although the rest of the long
slimy body was concealed in the pond.</p>

<p>"That's just like Benzeor," said Tom
aloud, as he dropped his pail, and picking up
a stone threw it savagely at the head he
could see a few yards out from the bank.</p>

<p>The head instantly disappeared, and Tom
turned to watch the bird, which now was
hopping about in the bushes, uttering harsh
little notes of relief.</p>

<p>"You're all right now, old lady," said
Tom. "Go back and tend to your babies.
I only wish I could serve every crawling
thing the way I served your enemy."</p>

<p>He soon arrived at the end of his journey,
and, placing his gun within easy reach, began
his task for the day. Why he had put off
his conversation with Benzeor he could not
explain. But the energy with which he began
his work served to afford a measure of
relief for his pent-up feelings, and when the
noon hour at last came he had done far more
work than a morning often witnessed.</p>

<p>Once he had stopped suddenly when he
thought he heard the report of a gun in the
distance. The sound had twice been repeated,
but it seemed to be muffled and far away,
and as he resumed his labor he tried to persuade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
himself that it was only Little Peter
firing at the blackbirds or the thieving crows.</p>

<p>The reports had made him anxious, however,
and when he had stopped for dinner he
had kept his gun near him all the time. The
silence served to increase his feeling of loneliness.
On every side stood the forests; and
the great trees, which had never as yet felt
the stroke of the axe, were companions without
sympathy.</p>

<p>With a feeling of desperation Tom soon
resumed his labors. The sun passed over
his head and began to sink below the tops of
the taller trees. He had stopped for a moment
to wipe his dripping face and gain a
brief rest, when he was startled by the sight
of some one emerging from the forest.</p>

<p>He gazed for a moment intently at the new-comer,
and soon recognized Sarah. What
was the trouble? Her dress had been torn by
the bushes, her hair had become loose and
was streaming down her back. But her disheveled
appearance was not the worst, for as
Tom dropped his hoe and ran across the lot
to meet her, he saw that her eyes were filled
with an expression of terror, and her face
betrayed the wild alarm which seemed to
possess the swiftly running girl.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE PARTING OF THE WAYS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What's</span> wrong, Sarah? What is it?
What is it?" said Tom excitedly, as he drew
near the almost breathless girl. "Has anything
happened at the house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom!" was all that Sarah at first
could say. The reaction from her excitement
and the swift pace at which she had been
running had come, and the frightened girl
burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>Tom looked on in helpless amazement.
Sarah was usually such a strong and self-contained
girl that her present distress was all
the more perplexing. He looked at her a
moment, feeling how utterly unable he was
to comprehend the state of her feelings and
how helpless he was to aid or comfort her.
Benzeor might be faced; and even Fenton, in
spite of the fear with which Tom regarded
him, might be met; but a weeping girl was
entirely outside the realm of all his previous
experiences, and he stood leaning upon his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
gun, eager to do something to aid Sarah, and
feeling a deep sympathy for her as he silently
watched her.</p>

<p>Perhaps his silence was the very best aid
he could offer, for in a brief time the resolute
Sarah gained control of herself, and lifting
her tear-stained face to that of the troubled
lad by her side she said, "Oh Tom, they've
killed Little Peter's mother!"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Tom in amazement.
"Killed her? You can't mean it! Who
killed her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they shot her, and have carried off
his father, too."</p>

<p>"I don't understand, Sarah," said Tom
more quietly. "Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Little Peter came over to our house just
a little while ago to leave the children, and
he told us all about it. It seems, he was the
lookout yesterday down by the Hook and
didn't get home till it was almost light this
morning.</p>

<p>"He said he went up to his room and laid
down upon his bed, and must have gone
to sleep, but he was waked up by the sound
of the voices of men in the house. He
jumped out of bed and listened, and pretty
soon he heard one of them tell his mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that she must hand over the money she had
hidden in a stocking up in the garret, and
tell where his father was.</p>

<p>"She refused to do either, and then Little
Peter hurriedly dressed and ran down the
stairs, but some of the men just grabbed him
and held him fast so that he couldn't do
anything to help his mother. He said the
men all had masks on their faces except
Fenton, for he thinks it was Fenton's band
that did the work, and he was sure he recognized
the blacksmith."</p>

<p>"No doubt about that!" exclaimed Tom.
"What did they do then?"</p>

<p>"They held his mother while some of them
ran up into the garret, and pretty soon one
of them came back with the stocking. They
made quite a time over that, and Little Peter
thought they wouldn't do anything more,
but it seems they didn't find as much money
in the stocking as they expected. Little
Peter explained it to me by saying that his
mother had divided it, and had hidden a part
in the garden back of the house and left only
a part in the stocking.</p>

<p>"For a little time they didn't suspect that,
but wanted to know where her husband was.
Of course she didn't tell them. How could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
she, when he wasn't there? Well, they
searched the place high and low. They tore
open the feather beds, and broke down the
walls in two or three places, but they couldn't
find Peter. Then they went out into the
barns and searched them, but not a trace of
him could they find. They must have been
pretty angry by that time, for when they
came back to the house they told her they
knew there must be more money than they
had found in the stocking, and she must tell
them where it was.</p>

<p>"Just then one of the children called out
that she knew where it was for she had seen
her mother dig a hole in the ground and put
a bag of money in it. Two of the men then
took the child out into the garden and tried
to make her show them the place where the
money was, but she must either have forgotten
or else did not know, for the men came
back into the house more angry than before,
and told her mother that she must go with
them and show them the place.</p>

<p>"Of course she refused, and then Fenton
raised his gun and told her he'd give her till
he could count five, to tell. She didn't say
a word, and when the blacksmith had counted
four he stopped a minute to give her a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
chance to speak. He waited, and as she only
shook her head the outlaw pulled the trigger
and shot her in the breast."</p>

<p>"And killed her?" inquired Tom in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, killed her. The bullet must have
struck her heart, for Little Peter said she fell
dead. They threw the body on the bed and
then they turned upon Little Peter. He said
he thought his turn had come then, but at
that very minute the guard they had stationed
down by the road came running into the
house, and going up to Fenton whispered
something in his ear.</p>

<p>"Little Peter didn't know what it was, he
said, but in a minute Fenton turned to his
men and gave them some directions, and they
all stopped and went out of the house, that
is, all except two, who were looking after
Little Peter and the children.</p>

<p>"In almost no time Little Peter heard
some one coming up the lane on horseback
and stop right before the kitchen door. He
heard him jump off from the horse, and after
a pause of a minute the men all made a rush
out of the house. Pretty soon they came
back, and Little Peter saw that his own father
was a prisoner in their hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"He said his father took on fearfully when
he saw his wife dead, and what the men had
been doing, but in a minute they bound him
hand and foot, and put a gag in his mouth,
and then he was as helpless as a baby in their
hands.</p>

<p>"Little Peter said he didn't know what
was coming next. He thought they'd torture
him or his father into telling where the money
was, or would set fire to the house; but before
they could do anything the guard came
running into the house again and called out
that some one was coming.</p>

<p>"They only stopped long enough to tie
Little Peter to the post of the very bed on
which his mother was lying dead, and then
they made a break out of the house and took
their horses and were off down the lane in no
time."</p>

<p>"How did you hear about it? How did
Little Peter get away?" said Tom slowly.</p>

<p>"Why, in a few minutes Indian John came
into the house, and he set Little Peter free.
'Twas lucky for him that he did, for Fenton
might have come back, you see."</p>

<p>"And Little Peter came over to your house
with the children, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he brought them all over, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
they're at our house now. But, oh Tom, it's
dreadful! dreadful! I'm so afraid they'll
come to our place next, and so I ran out here
to get you. Come Tom! Come right away!
They may be there now!"</p>

<p>Tom hesitated, not knowing just what to
do. He was only a boy, and knew that alone
he could do nothing against Fenton and his
band. But the appeal of Sarah and the unprotected
condition of the children and her
mother moved him strongly, and his first impulse
was to return with the frightened girl.</p>

<p>"Sarah," said he abruptly, "where is your
father?"</p>

<p>"Why, you know he went away this morning,
and he hasn't come back yet. He said
he might not be back before to-morrow morning.
We're all alone, Tom, and you must
come right away. Oh, it's awful!" And
Sarah buried her face in her hands again as
she spoke.</p>

<p>It was almost upon Tom's lips to tell her
what he knew of Benzeor. But the misery
of the weeping girl before him was even
stronger than the impression produced by the
sad tale she had just related, and he could
not quite bring himself up to the point of
telling her what he suspected,&mdash;that her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
father had been connected with the attack
upon Little Peter's home. But he had decided
now as to the course of action he must
follow.</p>

<p>"Sarah," said he gently, "there isn't the
least danger in the world that your house will
be attacked. I can't tell you how I know,
but I know it's so."</p>

<p>"But we're all alone, Tom! I don't
know what you mean! We're as likely to be
attacked as any one. You must go back
with me! We must go right away, for they
may be there now! Poor mother, she was so
frightened that she didn't want me to leave
and come over here for you! Come! We
must go right back now!"</p>

<p>"Sarah, I'm never going into that house
again. You can tell your father that I've
slept for the last time under his roof."</p>

<p>"Not going back with me?" said Sarah
aghast, and looking up in surprise as she
spoke. "Not going back?" she repeated,
as if she did not fully understand what Tom
had said.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not going back," said Tom
firmly. "You know I've been thinking a
good while of leaving, and after what you've
just told me I know the time has come."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The color slowly faded from Sarah's face
and a different expression came into her eyes.
Even her alarm was apparently forgotten for
the moment, and as Tom looked at her, her
eyes seemed to snap and a sneer replaced the
look of sorrow.</p>

<p>"Tom Coward, you're afraid!" she said;
"that's what's the trouble with you. You're
afraid, that's what you are! You'd rather
leave mother and me alone there with the
children than run any risks of meeting the
blacksmith! I wouldn't have believed it,
but my father was right. You're a coward
by nature as well as by name."</p>

<p>"Sarah"&mdash;began Tom, his face flushing
at the words of the angry girl.</p>

<p>"Don't 'Sarah' me! I know you now!
I never could have believed it, never! But
I've heard you with my own ears, and now I
know it's true! You're afraid! You're a
coward, that's just what you are! Oh, you're
well named, you are! Very well, sir, it shall
be as you say. Perhaps we shall be better
off without you than we would with you, for
it would only make another child for us to
look after if you should come back! I'll go
back home and face Fenton and every one
of his band myself! I'm afraid, but I'm no
coward!"</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;TOM COWARD, YOU&#39;RE AFRAID!&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning abruptly away, after giving Tom
a glance which he never forgot, she started
resolutely and swiftly back along the pathway
which she had followed in her flight to
the ten-acre lot.</p>

<p>Tom looked after her in helpless amazement.
Never before had he heard such an
outburst from the gentle and even-tempered
Sarah, who had been the leading spirit in
Benzeor's household. The children had gone
to her with their troubles rather than to their
mother, and Sarah had never failed to have a
word of comfort or of help for every one.
Even Benzeor himself had come to depend
upon her judgment in many of his affairs,
and she had been as patient and gentle with
him as she had been with the troubled little
ones.</p>

<p>And to Tom she had been the one true
friend he had ever known. Somehow she
had always understood him, and from the
days of their early childhood it had always
been a matter of pride to him that he was her
acknowledged champion and protector. Many
a time, when he was a sturdy little lad, had he
taken her part against the tormenting boys
in the school. For her he had carved quaint
and strange looking dolls out of horse-chestnuts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and the childish Sarah had never failed
to receive them with many expressions of
pleasure, and had lavished a wealth of affection
upon them which was almost as pleasing
to Tom as to the little mother herself. For
her he had gathered the chestnuts in the
autumn and the bright colored flowers in the
springtime; and when, with the passing of
the years, there had come to them both new
feelings and new interests, he still had shared
with her all those dimly perceived ambitions
and longings which are ever present in the
boyish heart when it arrives at that position
where it can look out upon the time when the
boy is to become a man.</p>

<p>Perhaps Tom had enjoyed her sympathy
and interest the more because of the loneliness
of his own position. But Sarah never
by word or act had caused him to feel that
he was only Benzeor Osburn's "bound boy,"
and not truly one of the household.</p>

<p>Tom was thinking of some of these things
as he watched the departing girl, and, forgetting
for the moment all the anger and shame
which her last words had aroused, he called
aloud after her.</p>

<p>"Sarah! Sarah!" he shouted. "Wait a
minute! Come back! Come back!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah apparently did not hear him, or heed
him if she heard, and without once turning
her head or looking behind her soon disappeared
in the forest.</p>

<p>An impulse to follow her seized Tom, and
he even ran a few steps after her, but quickly
stopped. How could he explain himself to
her without informing upon Benzeor? And
then her sorrow would be harder for him to
bear than her present anger, hard as that was.
No; all he could do was to remain silent for
the time, and trust that in the future some
explanation might be made which should set
him aright once more in the estimation of
the best friend the homeless boy had ever
known.</p>

<p>The departure of Sarah left him face to
face with the perplexing problem of what
he was now to do. To return to Benzeor's
house was impossible; but where should he
go?</p>

<p>Tom stood for several minutes in deep
thought. There was no home which would
now be open to him except Little Peter's,
and that had been wrecked by the dreadful
deeds of Fenton and his followers. Washington's
army he had heard was at Hopewell,
and that was at least forty miles away. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was to the army he had ultimately hoped to
go, and perhaps the present was the very
time to which he had been looking forward
so long.</p>

<p>The longer he thought about it the more
strongly was he impressed with the conviction
that his best plan would be to try to make
his way to Hopewell, or to the place to which
the army might have moved by this time.
It was true he was without provisions, and
he knew of no place in which he would be
likely to obtain any, or in which he might
find a resting-place for a night. Of the long
journey he thought but little, for a walk
even of forty miles had no terrors for him.</p>

<p>Tom decided to start for Washington's
army, but first he must stop at Little Peter's
and learn what his friend's plans were to be,
and offer him such aid as it lay within his
power to give.</p>

<p>The decision once made, Tom picked up
his rifle, which now he somehow had come
to regard as his own property, and started
through the forest toward the distant road.</p>

<p>When at last he gained it and started
towards Little Peter's home, he was startled
as he saw some one running down the road,
and his first impulse was to conceal himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in the forest and wait for the stranger to pass;
but his fears were relieved when he recognized
the long lope of the runner, and then
knew that his old friend Indian John was
approaching.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>INDIAN JOHN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Indian John</span> had for years been a frequent
visitor in the home of Benzeor, as he had in
many of the other homes of the region. He
was an old man now,&mdash;how old no one knew,
perhaps not even Indian John himself,&mdash;but
he had lingered about old Monmouth long
after the Schwonnack had taken possession
of the lands and his own tribe had gradually
relinquished their homes and mostly withdrawn
from the region.</p>

<p>For months together he would disappear,
and no one would know whither he had
gone, although it was thought that he was
on a visit to some of his kindred, who had
withdrawn farther into the interior of the
country; but he would soon return and resume
his wandering life. At such times,
Indian John would be restless and uneasy.
Perhaps then he realized more fully the loss
of the homes of his ancestors, and his heart
would be filled with thoughts he never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
uttered. He continued to be friendly with
the settlers, and though he never refused to
accept the food which almost every housewife
was willing to give him, he had never been
willing to pass a night under a roof. It was
commonly reported that he used a cave in
the woods not far away as his abode, but he
never had welcomed any one there, nor had
any one ever seen the aged Indian in the
place. Still the report was believed, and
"Indian John's cave" was a well-known
name among the boys of Old Monmouth.</p>

<p>Between Tom and the lonely warrior there
had been a very strong feeling of sympathy,
although not even Tom himself was able to
explain it. It had come about, however, as
the result of an accidental meeting between
them a few years previous to this time.
Tom had gone down to the shore one day
when a storm had been raging, and the
great breakers had been rolling in upon the
beach.</p>

<p>As the lad had walked on over the sand,
he had been surprised to see the figure of a
man in the distance, standing motionless, and
evidently watching the tumult of the angry
waters. He had not changed from his position
as Tom approached, and the lad did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
know that his presence was even recognized
by the Indian, who seemed to be absorbed in
his reflections as he looked out over the tossing
waves.</p>

<p>Tom had gone on and at last touched the
Indian upon the shoulder. Indian John had
then slowly turned his head, and Tom knew
that his presence had been perceived, but for
a moment neither had spoken.</p>

<p>Then the aged warrior, with a gesture
toward the ocean, had said, "Boy no home.
Warrior no home. Brothers."</p>

<p>It was the first time Tom had known that
Indian John was aware of his own early history,
and his heart had been deeply touched
by the sympathy of the red man.</p>

<p>"Boy no home. Warrior no home. Both
like waves. Driven here. Driven there. No
rest. No home. Storm there. Storm here,"
said the Indian laying his hand upon his
bosom as he spoke.</p>

<p>From that time, although Indian John
never referred to his loneliness again, a
strong bond of sympathy had existed between
the two, and every time Tom had seen the
old man, he thought of his quiet eloquence in
the presence of that storm which they both
had witnessed from the shore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>And Indian John had been kind and
thoughtful to all the white children of the
region. He had made bows for the boys,
and taught them their use, and as their skill
had increased, his pride was as marked,
although it had not been as demonstrative,
as that of the youthful warriors themselves.
He had taught them how to make and set
their traps for the foxes and the rabbits,
and how to catch the eels in the river. Apparently
his happiest hours had been those
which he passed with his young companions.</p>

<p>Highly as the boys had prized the lessons
he had given them, still more did they prize
the marvelous tales which Indian John could
tell. To them he told what the waves were
saying when they came rolling in upon the
sandy shore. He knew what the tall trees
were whispering when the wind swept through
their branches and brought the leaves into
contact with one another. The hoarse calls
of the wild geese, when they passed high
overhead on their long journeys in the spring
and autumn, were all known to Indian John,
and the screams of the eagles and the fish-hawks
were all in a language which he
clearly understood.</p>

<p>He knew, also, all the tales his fathers had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
told him of the first appearance of the Woapsiel
Lennape in Old Monmouth, when, in
the spring of 1524, John de Verrazano, in his
good ship The Dolphin, had entered Sandy
Hook, and had soon after written a long
letter to King Francis the First of France,
and had given a full account of the marvelous
adventures which had befallen him, and
the no less marvelous country he had discovered.
He had heard, also, of the visit, in
the summer of 1609, which Sir Henry Hudson
had made in The Half Moon, and how
that one of his crew had fallen as the first
victim of the rage of the Indians at the
invasion of their lands.</p>

<p>The tale which Tom had always enjoyed
most, however, was that of the origin of the
troublesome little pests which, in the warm
days of the summer, were the torment of the
people, for Jersey mosquitoes were not unknown
in those far-off times of the Revolution.</p>

<p>It seemed that ages before this time, indeed
away back in the days before John de
Verrazano or Henry Hudson had come, or
even the memory of the oldest warriors could
run, the Great Spirit had permitted two huge
monsters to appear and prey upon the red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
men of Monmouth as a penalty for some
crime they had committed, a crime the nature
of which Indian John did not know, or, if he
knew, he never explained.</p>

<p>In size these monsters were larger than
any house. They had long slender legs
which held their huge bodies higher in the
air than the tallest trees could have done.
They also had immense wings, which, although
they were as fine in texture as the finest silk,
were so large and strong that when the huge
monsters used them they created such a
breeze that even the strongest trees of the
forest fell before them.</p>

<p>Their most distinguishing characteristic,
however, was an immense "bill," which was
as long as the tallest pine-tree and as sharp
and delicate in its point as that of the smallest
needle. With this they wrought incalculable
destruction and suffering among the
helpless people. The largest man served
only as a single "bite," and the bodies of
little children seemed only to whet the appetite
of these savage monsters.</p>

<p>The helpless warriors knew not what to do.
They sacrificed, and prayed, and besought the
Great Spirit to free them from their tormentors,
but all was without avail. Their prayers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
were unanswered, and the Great Spirit was
not appeased.</p>

<p>No man could describe the destruction
wrought by the huge tormentors. Whole
tribes disappeared before them, and it soon
came to pass that the warriors dared not
venture forth in search of food for their
starving little ones, who were kept concealed
in dens and caves of the earth. Watchers
were stationed to give warning of the approach
of the monsters, for their great bodies
cast shadows upon the earth like those of
the low-passing clouds on a summer day,
and long before they appeared in the sky the
cry of the watchman sent all within the sound
of his voice to their places of refuge under
the ground. Not even then were they always
safe, for the monsters could bore into the
ground with their bills, and often brought to
the surface the body of a man, who struggled
and kicked much after the fashion of a frog
impaled on the beak of some long-legged
heron. The torments of the people increased.
The women neglected their fields, and the
warriors remained in their hiding-places, while
the frightened children cried for food.</p>

<p>At last, rendered desperate by their sufferings,
the warriors of the entire region banded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
themselves together, and one day fell upon
the monsters as they were lying asleep in a
valley which their immense bodies almost
filled.</p>

<p>The carnage was frightful to behold. All
day long the contest was waged, and the multitudes
of men that fell could not be counted
up for numbers. But at last the red men
were victorious, and when the few remaining
warriors left the field of battle, their enemies
lay stretched upon the valley, dead.</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing among the people.
They came forth from their hiding-places,
and their feastings and songs of victory were
continued for two entire days. The land
was freed from its tormentors, and peace and
prosperity would now return, or so at least
they thought.</p>

<p>Great was the astonishment and sorrow of
Indian John's forefathers when, upon the
third day, they discovered that their troubles
were not ended. As decay had begun to
work upon the dead bodies of the mammoth
mosquitoes, little particles became loosened,
and as they were lifted into the air by the
summer wind, each tiny and separate atom
became endowed with life and received a
body in shape exactly like that of the huge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
monsters themselves, only they were exceedingly
small in size. Day after day clouds of
these tiny torments were borne away by the
breezes from the valley of the dead, and,
filled with a burning desire to avenge the
death of their parents, they fell upon the
unprotected people.</p>

<p>From these there had been no relief.
The camp-fires of the warriors did not avail,
and although the men went valiantly forth to
give them battle, their efforts were all futile,
and from that day until the present time the
Jersey mosquito has remained a foe to the
red man and the white, and ever consumed
by the one purpose, to avenge the death of
the parents, who had fallen years ago in their
battle with the red-skinned warriors of Old
Monmouth.</p>

<p>To Indian John this story of the origin of
the pests of New Jersey had been eminently
satisfactory, and never by word or deed had
he shown that he had the slightest doubt of
the accuracy of the tradition which had come
down to him through many generations.
Tom at first had received the account with
all the implicit faith of an ardent admirer of
Indian John, and his first rude shock had
come when Benzeor had laughed aloud upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
his relating the story with all seriousness one
morning at the breakfast-table. With the
passing of the years other doubts as to the
entire reliability of some of Indian John's
stories had crept into his mind. Alas that it
should be so with us all! But his strong
regard for the old warrior had never ceased,
and Tom's heart was glad that morning when
he recognized the new-comer as his long-time
friend.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, John?" he said,
as the Indian approached.</p>

<p>"See Peter."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?" said Tom eagerly.
"Where is he? Has he got away?"</p>

<p>"How?" replied the Indian quickly; and
Tom at once perceived from the expression
upon his face that he was aware of some but
not of all the recent events in Peter's home.</p>

<p>As he related the story which Sarah had
told him, Indian John made no reply, although
his eyes seemed to blaze as he listened to
Tom's words. He then explained that he
had left the house soon after Tom had departed
on the preceding night, to intercept
Big Peter on the road and give to him the
warning which his wife had bidden him to
carry. But Peter must have returned by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
different route from that which he had been
expected to use, and as a natural result Indian
John had not seen him, the warning word
had not been given, and Big Peter had returned
to learn of the sad death of his wife
and to be carried away a prisoner by Fenton
and his brutal band.</p>

<p>"I don't know just what to do now,
John," said Tom. "I want to go and join
the army. You have been there, and perhaps
you would like to go back with me."</p>

<p>Indian John had been with the soldiers in
Washington's army, but he made no reply to
Tom's words, and indeed the lad was not
certain that he had heard, for he stood looking
upon the ground and evidently was thinking
deeply.</p>

<p>"Where Little Peter now?" said the Indian
abruptly, looking up at Tom as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Fenton didn't take him
with him, though I don't know why he
didn't."</p>

<p>"Little Peter home," said the Indian decidedly.
"Go see Little Peter."</p>

<p>Tom hesitated. He, too, had longed to
go to his friend, not only to express his sympathy
but also to learn what his plans were
to be, for he knew that Little Peter would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
not remain in his home now. Indeed, he
could not, if he would, after such a scene as
that which he had witnessed there. But
Tom's mind was filled with thoughts of Benzeor,
and a meeting with him certainly was
not very desirable at that time.</p>

<p>"Go see Little Peter," said the Indian
again, starting on up the road as he spoke.</p>

<p>"All right, I'll go with you," replied Tom,
as he joined his companion.</p>

<p>Little Peter's house was not far away, and
he would not lose much time in going there.
It was almost night now, and if his friend
should be at home they might be able to
devise some plan by which they could act
together. Besides all that, Tom was more
than glad to have an opportunity to express
his sympathy for his friend in his sorrow.</p>

<p>They soon came within sight of the house,
and both stopped when they saw a little
group of people near the garden. Tom knew
at once what their presence meant, for they
were near the spot where two of the members
of the family had been buried. He had seen
the rude wooden headstones which marked
their graves many times before this.</p>

<p>The few neighbors who had assembled to
perform the last rites for Little Peter's mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
had just returned to the house as Tom and
Indian John approached. Tom at once went
to his friend, and the warm grasp of the hand
was all he could give. Not one of the children
save Little Peter was there, and the hurried
duties had been hastily performed by
kind, though rough hands.</p>

<p>The two boys withdrew from the house, and
after an awkward silence Tom said in a low
voice, "What are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to leave the children at Benzeor's
house. He has been very kind, or
rather Sarah has, Tom. And then I'm going
to start for Refugee Town; I think father
may be there."</p>

<p>"Refugee Town?" said Tom in surprise.
"Do you think that will be safe?"</p>

<p>Tom well knew the place. It was a spot
on the outer beach of the Hook, where some
of the more desperate refugees, tories and
negroes, had assembled. A few huts and
tents served as their dwelling-places, and the
men were supposed to be in league with the
men on board the boats which the British had
stationed near by, for a part of Howe's fleet
was already anchored there, waiting for the
coming of Clinton's men. Clinton's original
plan had been to march across Jersey to New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Brunswick, there embark his men on the Raritan,
and sail away for New York; but the
rapid march of Washington had caused him
to abandon the project, and word had been
sent for the fleet to be ready for him when
he should arrive at the Highlands.</p>

<p>Refugee Town had become a familiar name
within the past few weeks.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't safe exactly, but I've got to
do something for father. If he's taken to
New York and shut up in the sugar-house
I'll go with him; and if he's still there at
the Town I may be able to do something,
though I don't know what," said Little Peter
sadly.</p>

<p>"But there are the children," protested
Tom. "What'll become of them?"</p>

<p>"They're at Benzeor's, and they'll be all
right. You'll help look after them, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"I've left Benzeor's."</p>

<p>"Left Benzeor's? What for?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to join the army. It's time I
was doing my share."</p>

<p>Tom gave no other reason. He knew the
children would be safe at Benzeor's, and with
what Little Peter then had it in his mind to
do it would perhaps be unwise to tell him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
all he knew. However, he intended to tell
him all, and that soon.</p>

<p>"Going to join the army?" repeated Little
Peter, as if he did not comprehend the words.</p>

<p>"Yes; you know I've been thinking of it
a long time, and now that they're on the
march, and coming this way, I've made up
my mind that my turn has come. I didn't
know but you would want to go, too, now."</p>

<p>"I'd like to, but I can't. I've got this
other matter on hand. Come into the house,
Tom, and spend the night with me. You
can start in the morning as well as now, and
besides it's almost dark. You can't go in
the night."</p>

<p>Tom hesitated, but finally consented, and
with his friend went into the house which so
recently had been the scene of the greatest
sorrow which had ever entered Little Peter's
life.</p>

<p>Indian John followed them, but after his
custom refused to remain, although he promised
to return early in the morning. One of
the women of the neighborhood had stayed
to look after Little Peter's immediate wants,
but as soon as her duties were done she departed
for her own home with an eagerness
she could not entirely conceal. And Tom did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
not blame her, for he himself was not without
fear when at last Little Peter closed the
doors for the night, and, after having slipped
the heavy bars into their places, the two boys
sought their bed in the low room over the
kitchen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was long before daylight when the boys
were stirring on the morning which followed
the events recorded in the preceding chapter.
No one had disturbed them, and with the
return of the day their courage was somewhat
revived. Tom, however, had decided to start
at once for the army, which he knew from
Indian John's words was not many miles
away. He was thoroughly familiar with all
the roads in the county, for he had ridden
over them many times in company with Benzeor,
or when he had been sent on errands to
the more remote regions by his foster father,
and consequently had no fears of losing his
way.</p>

<p>Little Peter did not urge his friend to
accompany him on his expedition to Refugee
Town, for he was aware of the perils that
were likely to beset him on his journey. He
would not listen to any of the protests of
Tom, for he was fully determined to learn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
what had become of his father, and even
share his experiences if the occasion demanded.
And Tom could not find it in his
heart to blame Little Peter, hopeless as he
considered all his efforts likely to be. Perhaps
he would do the same thing if his own
father had been carried away by the pine
robbers, and he found himself conjecturing
how it was a boy would feel in such circumstances
as those in which his friend had been
placed. The feeling was one of which he
knew nothing by experience, and his own
loneliness seemed to press upon him with a
heavier weight.</p>

<p>However, he still said nothing to Little
Peter concerning Benzeor's recent actions,
for he was well assured that his friend's
younger brothers and sisters could be in no
place where they would so easily escape all
further troubles for the present as in his
foster father's house; and then all of Little
Peter's plans would be changed at once if he
knew the part which his neighbor had taken
in the tragedy which had recently occurred.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Indian John will go with me,"
said Little Peter. "He'll be a great help if
he'll go."</p>

<p>"That he will," replied Tom, "and I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sure he'll be glad to go with you. I should
like to go myself."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Tom; I know you would,
but you couldn't do any good, and might
only get into trouble yourself. Perhaps I'll
be with you in a day or two, if I don't hear
anything about my father down by Refugee
Town,&mdash;that is, if Benzeor is willing for the
children to stay in his house. I'll have to
look after them, you see, for it's likely I'll
have to be father and mother, as well as big
brother, now," he added sadly.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said Tom; "but I'm
hoping you'll have good luck, and if the
army really is coming here, it may be that
you'll get some help from the Continentals if
you need it then. Good-by, Peter."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Tom," replied his friend.</p>

<p>Tom placed some bread in his pockets, and
then started forth on his journey. Somewhere
off towards Hopewell the American
army must be, according to all the reports
which had come, and to that place he must
make his way. The time for which he had
been waiting at last had come, and with a
lighter heart than he had known for days the
lad began his journey.</p>

<p>The summer morning was clear and warm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
The birds were flitting about in the trees and
filling the air with their songs. In spite of
the heat, there was a delicious freshness in
the early morning air, and as he walked rapidly
forward he soon came to feel a sense of
exhilaration which not even the loss and grief
of his boy friend could entirely banish.</p>

<p>By the time the sun rose red and full
in the east, he had placed several miles between
him and Little Peter's home, but with
unabated zeal he steadily pushed onward,
resolved to make the best possible use of the
early hours before the more intense heat of
the day should come.</p>

<p>By the middle of the forenoon more than
ten miles had been left behind him, but he
was beginning to feel the effects of his exertions.
His face was flushed and streaming
with perspiration. The rough road was hot
and dusty, for only a single day had been required
to dry out all the vestiges of the recent
storm. He was beginning to feel somewhat
tired, and was about to stop for a brief rest
by the roadside, when he saw some one approaching
on horseback.</p>

<p>He quickly drew back among the trees
which grew close to the road, thereby hoping
to escape all notice by the stranger; but his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
plan was quickly changed when he discovered,
as the horseman came nearer, that he was clad
in the uniform of the Continental army. His
relief was greater when he recognized the
man as the son of one of Benzeor's neighbors,
who more than a year before this time
had enlisted and had passed the preceding
winter in Valley Forge.</p>

<p>He quickly resolved to hail the man as he
passed, and accordingly stepped out into the
road and waved his arms as a signal for
the horseman to stop. The man quickly
heeded, and as he drew the rein and checked
his horse he peered down at the lad by the
roadside, and Tom's fears were instantly relieved
when he perceived that he had been
recognized.</p>

<p>"Why, Tom Coward, what are you doing
here? Nothing wrong over home, is there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there is;" and Tom at once proceeded
to give young Lieutenant Gordon an
account of all that had occurred in the past
three days.</p>

<p>"That's bad," said the lieutenant slowly,
patting his horse's dripping neck as he spoke.
"That's bad. I wish I could take a company
and go over there this minute. I can't,
though; it's out of the question. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
army will be here shortly now, and there
may be a chance to give these pine robbers
a dose then. Where are you going now,
Tom?"</p>

<p>"I thought I'd start for the army," replied
Tom. "I've no other place to go to, and
I've been waiting to join it a long time."</p>

<p>The lieutenant smiled at the lad's words as
he replied, "That's all right. You're a
well-grown fellow, and I doubt not they'll
find a place somewhere for you in the Jersey
militia. There are younger fellows than you
there."</p>

<p>"So I hear," replied Tom eagerly. "Indian
John told me the army was over by
Hopewell, and had halted there, so I thought
I'd put straight for that place."</p>

<p>"There isn't very much of the militia
there now," said the lieutenant. "They're
mostly regulars at Hopewell, and I doubt not
have started from there before this."</p>

<p>"Where are the militia then?" said Tom
quickly. "I've got a rifle here, and if I'm
to join them I want to know where they
are."</p>

<p>"That would be a little difficult to say just
at present, my lad," replied the lieutenant,
assuming a more fatherly air than the difference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
between their years would seem to warrant.
"That would be a little difficult to
say."</p>

<p>As Tom plainly showed his disappointment,
the young officer continued: "You
see it's this way, Tom. It was early in the
morning of the 18th when the last of General
Clinton's forces marched out of the city
of Philadelphia. They went by the way
of Gloucester Point, about three miles below
Camden, and then the entire force,
with Knyphausen and his Hessians in advance,
marched over to Haddonfield and
halted there. We had means up at Valley
Forge of finding out what was going on, and
before they were fairly out of Philadelphia
some of our scouting parties and light horse
were in the city, and they gathered in about
sixty or seventy prisoners and were back
again at the Forge with the men and the
news. By three o'clock that same day General
Lee's division had started, and by five
o'clock General Wayne's had gone, too.
They lost no time over there, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," said Tom.
"Where are the militia, and what are you
doing here?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm explaining to you,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
replied the lieutenant. "Well, at five o'clock
the next morning,&mdash;that was the 19th of
June, you know,&mdash;Washington had the
rest of the army on the march for Coryell's
Ferry; but the roads were so heavy&mdash;for
we've been having some great rains this
month&mdash;that the divisions which had been
sent out didn't cross the Delaware until
Saturday morning, and the main body till
Monday. And all this time the British
were mighty careful, let me tell you. They
thought Washington was after their baggage-wagons
and stores, you see. Clinton and his
main body moved out of Haddonfield on
Friday, but he left Knyphausen and his
Dutch butchers, as well as two brigades of
the regulars behind him, while he marched
eight miles up to Evesham and went into
camp there. He wanted to keep his train of
baggage-wagons well protected, you see, for
the militia were doing all sorts of mischief.
You wanted to know where they were. Well,
that's where they were."</p>

<p>"They're away down at Haddonfield,
then, are they?"</p>

<p>"No, no. But they'd been sent out to
bother the British, you see, and try to hold
them back by skirmishes and a few such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
gentle deeds. They were tearing up bridges
and firing at the regulars from the woods,
and doing all sorts of things. Why, when
Clinton was marching from Haddonfield to
Evesham, General Leslie, who was in command
of his advanced guard, fell in with a
party of these very militia I'm telling you
about. Leslie hid some of his men in a rye-field,
and they saw Captain Jonathan Beesley.
He was a captain in the Cumberland County
militia, you know, and had been in the army
two years,&mdash;yes, and he was one of the best
men we ever had, too, let me tell you. Well,
Leslie's men saw Beesley and a couple of his
officers reconnoitring in advance of their
companies, and they fired on them. Captain
Beesley was wounded, and of course they took
him prisoner and carried him with them into
camp. They tried to get him to own up
what Washington's plans were, but Captain
Beesley just stopped them by saying they
wouldn't get a word out of him. And they
didn't; but the next day the poor fellow died
from his wounds. They'd taken him into
Hinchman Haines's house, you see, and that
was where he died. I understand that they
buried him there with the honors of war, and
I understand, too, that they've given permission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
for the body to be taken up and placed
in the Friends' burying-ground down at Haddonfield.
It may have been done before this,
for all that I know. Captain Beesley was a
good man. The redcoats couldn't do too
much for him."</p>

<p>"But where are the militia now? That's
what I want to know."</p>

<p>"And that's what I'm trying to tell you.
This is too hot to be standing out here in
the road. Let's go into the shade. I've got
time enough, and it may be a bit safer there,
too."</p>

<p>The lieutenant led his horse a short distance
into the woods, and, slipping the bridle-rein
over his head, he permitted him to graze,
while he himself resumed his story.</p>

<p>"At four o'clock the next morning,&mdash;that
was Saturday, the 20th,&mdash;Clinton took up the
line of march, but he only went seven miles,
as far as Mount Holly, and there he halted
till Monday. On Sunday, Knyphausen joined
him, having marched by the way of Moorestown.
The next morning they all marched
on to Black Horse and halted again, but at
five o'clock Tuesday morning they were up
and at it once more. They divided their
forces there a bit, Leslie going by the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of Bordentown, Clinton keeping on along the
road to Crosswicks, while Grant and the
Dutch butchers brought up the rear and
served as a kind of guard for the baggage-train.
All this was only yesterday, the 23d,
you see."</p>

<p>"But where are the militia now?" protested
Tom. "They are the ones I want to
join, not the British. You keep telling me
about them. What I want is the other side."</p>

<p>"Listen, then, and you shall hear. Yesterday
General Dickinson, with the Jersey militia,
was right there in Bordentown."</p>

<p>"What! when the British came up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, when the British came up, that is,
when Leslie's division did. Not all of the
militia were there, though. A good many
had been withdrawn and posted where they
could do the most good. There weren't very
many left in Bordentown, but when they found
out that Leslie was almost upon them, they
made up their minds in very short order that
the climate there was not the best in the world,
so they cleared out and left. But before they
went they left a few slight tokens of their
regard. They pulled up the planks of the
bridge there over Crosswicks Creek, and
raised the draw so that Leslie had to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
another crossing-place. Before they did that
they tried to fix up the bridge, but they were
fired upon, and I understand that four were
killed and quite a large number were wounded.</p>

<p>"Clinton, too, wasn't finding his road all
covered over with roses either. About five
hundred of our men met him as he came up
nearer to Crosswicks, and they thought they
were ready, but they weren't anything of the
kind. They had cut down a lot of trees and
stretched them across the road, but that didn't
stop the British. They came on just as if
they didn't mind marching over such little
things as trees, and there was a little skirmish
there, and two or three of the redcoats were
killed. One of their officers was shot and they
took him up to a house near by, and left him
there. Of course the Americans couldn't
stand there long, but they didn't run very
far.</p>

<p>"Well, the British divisions joined then
and started on again. They came to another
bridge and our men had it all fixed so that
they could just let it fall by one or two
strokes of an axe. They had one or two
little cannons there, too."</p>

<p>"Who did? The British?"</p>

<p>"No, our men. You know Sam Clevenger,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
don't you? Well, he stood there on the
bridge with his axe in his hands when the
British came in sight. He'd cut the sleepers
almost through, and when he saw the redcoats
coming, he lifted his axe, and the third
time he struck down went the bridge and all.
Then Clevenger started to run, but the British
fired at him and he fell dead. They'd
shot him in the back of the head. Our men
then fired their cannon once or twice, but all
they hit was the Friends' meeting-house. Of
course the British didn't mind that, and then
our men pulled back and left. That was
only yesterday. I shouldn't be surprised if
the British were over here by Allentown or
Imlaystown now, or it may be both."</p>

<p>"What! not more than ten or fifteen miles
away?" said Tom excitedly.</p>

<p>"That's what I say. And they'll be
nearer, too, before they're farther off, let me
tell you."</p>

<p>"Why? How? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"They'll never go to Brunswick or Amboy,
for Washington's right in front of
them, and ready to head them off. They'll
just have to come this way or go back, and
that they won't do, for 'Britons never retrograde.'
That's one of their pet words, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
know. Isn't that what John Burgoyne said,
too?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that," said
Tom. "Then General Washington has been
using a part of the militia and a part of the
regulars to bother Clinton and keep him from
getting to Brunswick or Amboy, has he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just it."</p>

<p>"Well, I shan't have very far to go, then,
to join them now."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're not going to join them.
You're coming with me. You're just such
a lad as I have been looking for, and you
can help me, if I'm not greatly mistaken."</p>

<p>As Tom made no reply except to look up
in surprise, the young officer at once began
to explain to him the nature of the task to
which he had referred.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE STORY OF THE MISCHIANZA</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I've</span> been sent out, as a good many
others have been, to look up the bridges over
the creeks" (the young officer called them
"runs," as many of the Jerseymen did then,
and still do for the matter of that) "and find
out the lay of the land. As I happened to
be born in Old Monmouth, and lived here
till I was a man grown, it was naturally
thought I'd be pretty well informed, so you
see I was selected for this special work. I
don't know that I object to it, but I'd rather
be back with my men."</p>

<p>"And that's what you've been doing, is
it?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been in that work ever since
the British started out from Philadelphia.
I've kept just a little ahead of the men all
the way, and have gone back every night to
report, and then the next day they'd follow
all my plans. You see I've got a map of
every road in the county here," and as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
spoke the young lieutenant drew from his
pocket a paper on which had been traced
every road and every little stream in the
region, while the places where bridges were
to be found were indicated by red marks.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he added, throwing back his
coat. "Isn't it warm! I don't believe
there's been a summer like this in years.
We've had showers and thunder-storms
almost every day. The air now feels as if
we'd get another one pretty soon, too."</p>

<p>The air was exceedingly sultry, and a
strange stillness seemed to be resting over all.
Not a leaf was stirring, and as Tom looked
up through the tops of the trees the bright
blue of the sky appeared to be more intense
than ever he had seen it before. Here and
there separate masses of heavy clouds could
be seen, which, with the sunlight streaming
through them, glistened almost like silver.
He knew the signs well. There was the
appearance of a coming shower.</p>

<p>"It's too hot to go on," said the young
lieutenant. "I'm almost afraid to take my
horse out in such heat. I've got the most
of my work for the day done, though, and I
thought that perhaps you might be able to
help me out, Tom. You must know every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
bridge in this part of the country. Now you
go over this map with me, and tell me if the
places are marked right. I've been gone so
long I'm not sure of myself, but you ought
to know. It'll save me a trip in this broiling
sun, if you can help me."</p>

<p>Tom took the map and looked over it carefully.
He was thoroughly familiar with the
roads and streams, as the lieutenant had intimated,
and in a brief time he had given him
all the information he possessed.</p>

<p>"There," said the lieutenant at last, folding
the paper and restoring it to his pocket
again, "that helps me out. I'd been over
most of the way, and the two or three places
you have told me about finishes the whole
thing. I'm ready to go back and report. I
think I'll take a bite, though, before I start,
and wait and see what the weather is likely
to be."</p>

<p>Going to his saddle-bags the young officer
brought out the dinner which he carried with
him. "Sometimes I stop at some farmhouse
and get something to eat," he explained,
"but it isn't always safe to trust to that, you
see, so I always go provided. I want you to
join me, Tom. It'll seem almost like old
times."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The horse had been tied to one of the trees,
and, as the lieutenant seated himself upon
the ground, Tom gladly joined him. He
was tired and hungry, and the piece of bread
which he had in his own pocket would keep,
and, as he was aware that he might find
further use for it, he was the more willing to
accept the invitation which had been given
him. For a few minutes neither spoke, for
they both seemed to be intent upon the
immediate duty.</p>

<p>As soon, however, as the first pangs of his
hunger were relieved Tom said, "I never
understood just why it was that the British
left Philadelphia. They'd been there all
winter, and after holding the city so long I
never could understand why it was that they
abandoned it without even a skirmish. What
did they do it for?"</p>

<p>"Why, the way of it was this," replied the
lieutenant, taking an unusually large bite of
the bread he was holding in his hand, as he
spoke. "You see, we'd been trying for a
long time to get up some kind of a treaty
with France. Ben Franklin, and I don't
know who all, had been over there trying to
work it up, and at last the Frenchmen agreed.
Our Congress ratified the treaty on the 4th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of last May, and that completely changed the
plans of the redcoats."</p>

<p>"I don't see just how that could do it,"
replied Tom, somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why it really means a declaration of war
by the French against the British. I don't
believe the Frenchmen care very much for
us, barring young Lafayette and a few others
of his kind, but they hate the British, and
took this way to get even with them. It's
expected that they'll send a fleet over here,
and of course the redcoats have got to be
ready to meet it,&mdash;that is, if they can. Well,
Philadelphia doesn't amount to very much
any way in war times. It isn't very easy
to get into it, so the British there thought
they'd better get out and go over to New
York, which was a good deal more likely to
be threatened by the French fleets. That's
the cause of the change, my lad."</p>

<p>"I should think the redcoats would feel
like giving up, now that the French are
going to join us."</p>

<p>The young officer laughed as he replied:
"That's just where you're mistaken, my
young friend. They don't feel that way
after they've sent so many armies over here
and have spent so much money in discovering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
us, you see. And then, too, they don't object
to getting a few taxes and such like
things out of us, either. I've a dim suspicion
that the Frenchmen may have just a
bit of a dream that they may get back some
of the country that dropped out of their
hands during the French and Indian war.
But, however that may be, we're glad to
have their help now, for we need it badly
enough, and will have to let the future take
care of itself."</p>

<p>"I don't see that any one can blame the
British for wanting to hold on to us. They
have spent a lot of money, and lots of their
soldiers have been killed in the wars with the
Indians and the Frenchmen."</p>

<p>"Oh no, we don't blame them," laughed
the lieutenant. "We don't blame them.
It's all natural enough for them to want to
hold on to us, but how about ourselves?
What about the Stamp Act and the tea tax?
What about all their oppression and the way
they've treated us? They seem to forget
that we're men of like passions with themselves.
Oh, it's all natural enough for them
to want to keep a good hold on us, but it's
just as natural for us to object to being held
on to. And, Tom, such things as have happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
lately, too! Why, this story about
Little Peter's mother is only one of a thousand
here in Jersey. I've been pretty much
all over the colony&mdash;the state, I mean&mdash;and
it's the same story everywhere. It's just
plundering, and robbing, and worse. And
then to bring over here those Dutch butchers,&mdash;that's
the worst of it all! To think of
hiring those butchers! Why, it just makes
my blood boil to think of it! And against
us, too, who are their own blood relatives!
That's more than human nature can stand!"</p>

<p>Tom felt the contagion of the young lieutenant's
enthusiasm, but he made no reply,
and his companion continued, "The redcoats
had a great time when they cleared out
of Philadelphia. I was there and saw it
myself."</p>

<p>"You were there? I thought you were
up at Valley Forge all winter!"</p>

<p>"So I was, when I wasn't in Philadelphia.
I had to go there sometimes, but I never
wore my uniform then. Oh no, I didn't
think it was very becoming to my peculiar
style of beauty, so I always left it behind
me."</p>

<p>"What were you, a spy?"</p>

<p>"That isn't what we call it," replied the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
young officer, lowering his voice and glancing
quickly about him at Tom's words, "Never
mind what I was, but I was there and that's
enough. I'm telling you now about the
time the redcoats had when Sir William Howe
gave over the command to Sir Henry Clinton.
His officers got it up as a kind of a farewell,
you see. They called it the Mischianza."</p>

<p>"What's that? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"What, the Mischianza? Oh, that's an
Italian word, and means a 'mix up' or a
'medley,' or some such thing; I don't know
just what. But I'm telling you now what
it was, and what they did. It commenced
with a kind of a regatta which they'd arranged
in three divisions. Up the river in
front came the Ferret galley, and on board
were some of the general officers and their
ladies. Then came the Centre galley,&mdash;that
was called the Hussar,&mdash;and carried both the
Howes and Clinton and their suites, along
with a lot of ladies. Behind came the Cornwallis
galley, in which were Knyphausen and
some of the British generals, and, of course, a
lot of ladies.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, they looked fine, I can tell you,
for I was in the crowd which watched the
affair from the shore, and I saw every bit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
it. On each quarter of the galleys there
were five flatboats, all lined with green, and
having lots of people on board. Then, in
front of the galleys, were three more flatboats,
and a band of music was on board of each,
and they could play, too, let me tell you, if
they were redcoats. Six rowed along each
flank, and they were all dressed up in bright
colors, and so were the ships and the transport
boats, which made a line all the way
down to the city. All the wharves were
crowded and the people were just wild. The
boats started out from Knight's wharf&mdash;that's
away up in the northern part of the
city, you know&mdash;and rowed all the way
down to Market wharf. There they rested
on their oars, the bands played 'God save the
King,' the people shouted and sang, and I
couldn't help feeling something of the excitement,
though I hate the very sight of a
redcoat.</p>

<p>"Well, they landed at the Old Fort, and
the bands were still playing, and the Roebuck
fired seventeen guns and then the Vigilant
fired seventeen more. The grenadiers had
been drawn up in a double file on shore, and
the company then marched up between the
lines. They had horsemen there, too, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
what with the bright dresses of the ladies
and the bright favors of blue and white ribbons
on the breasts of the managers, who
moved in front of the procession, and the
uniforms and all, it was a great sight. I
should have thought Lord Howe would almost
have been sorry he was going to leave.</p>

<p>"The avenue led up to a big lawn, which
was all fixed up with arches and rows of
benches, rising one above another, where the
ladies were to be seated; and then they had
some tilts and tournaments, something as they
used to have in old England. There were
young ladies there, too, lots of them, and they
were all dressed up in Turkish costumes, and
such like.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon the trumpets sounded, and
then a band of knights, dressed in red and
white silk, on horses all decked out in the
same colors, advanced. Lord Cathcart was
the chief, and he had squires to carry his
lances and others to carry his shield, and two
black slaves with silver clasps on their bare
necks and arms held his stirrups. The band
then marched around the square and saluted
the ladies, and then the herald, after a great
flourish of trumpets, declared the ladies of
the Blended Rose were ahead of all others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"When the challenge had been given the
third time, some other heralds and a trumpeter
came in, along with a lot of knights
dressed up in black and orange, and after
going through a lot of motions and the bands
had played, the herald proclaimed that the
Knights of the Burning Mountain were prepared
to contest the claim of the others.
Then the gauntlet was thrown down and
picked up, and the encounter began.</p>

<p>"After they had met four times, the two
leaders, Lord Cathcart and Captain Watson,
advanced and began a contest between themselves.
After they had kept it up a little
while, the marshal of the field rushed in between
them, and declared the ladies were all
right on either side, and commanded the men
to stop. Then bands filed off in different
directions, playing lively tunes and saluting
the ladies as they marched.</p>

<p>"Then the whole company marched through
great arches to the garden, and then up into
the hall, which had been painted up to resemble
Sienna marble. They had a faro table
in that room and one great cornucopia all filled
with flowers and fruit, and another one empty.
Then they went to the ballroom, which was
all painted in pale blue, and there were festoons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of flowers, and I don't know what all.
I never saw anything like it before. There
were eighty-five big mirrors in the room, and
they were all fixed out with ribbons and flowers,
and as they sent back the light from the
branches of waxlights, it made the room look
bright enough, I can tell you. On that
same floor they had four drawing-rooms,
where they got their refreshments, and these
rooms were all decorated and lighted up, too.</p>

<p>"They kept up the dancing till ten, and
then the fireworks began and the windows
were all thrown open. I remember that the
first of the fireworks was a great bouquet of
rockets,&mdash;but that was only one, and they
kept it up till twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>"When midnight came, the great folding
doors, which had been all covered over with
flowers so that no one knew they were there,
were thrown open, and there was a great
room all decorated and lighted up, most too
wonderful to tell about; and there, too, was
a great table, which they said had twelve
hundred dishes on it&mdash;just think of that,
will you?&mdash;and four hundred and thirty
people could sit down to the table at the same
time.</p>

<p>"They had supper then, and when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
had finished that part of the programme the
herald and trumpeters entered and proclaimed
the health of the king and the royal family.
Of course all the people there responded, and
then there was a toast for the knights, and
the ladies, and lots of others, and there was
a great flourish of trumpets as each toast was
announced.</p>

<p>"Then they all went back to the ballroom
and began to dance again. They kept it up
till four o'clock, and I don't know how much
later, for I left then."</p>

<p>"And you saw it all?" said Tom slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, almost every bit of it; 'twas a great
sight, too. The like of it has never been
seen before on this side of the water, and
never will be again, I'm thinking. By the
way, Tom, I heard a man there called by your
name. It was Captain Coward, I think&mdash;though
it may have been colonel or judge; I
don't just recollect."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for him."</p>

<p>"You needn't be. Just show that the
name's of no account. But I've got to
start now. I wish I could take you with me,
but I can't. I'll see you soon, though, so
good luck to you till we meet again."</p>

<p>"But it's raining," said Tom quickly, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the patter of the falling drops could be heard
on the leaves.</p>

<p>"Can't stop for that; I'm due at five
o'clock, rain or no rain. Good-by to you,
Tom, and thank you for your help. You've
saved me a hard ride in such a day as this!"</p>

<p>The young lieutenant was gone, and Tom
waited for the shower to pass. The rain continued
only a few minutes, but left the air
still more sultry than it had been before, and
walking became much more difficult.</p>

<p>However, Tom started on as soon as the
rain ceased, and kept steadily to his work
until the sun was low in the heavens. His
thoughts had been withdrawn, in a measure,
from the camp at Hopewell, and he was thinking
of the description which the young lieutenant
had given of the Mischianza, and the
brilliant scene which it must have presented.
What could the poor and desperate Continentals
do against men who had feasts like
that? And Captain, or Colonel, Coward,
who was he? Tom found himself thinking
of the man, and wondering how he came to
have the name.</p>

<p>He turned the bend in the road and saw
a band of soldiers marching directly toward
him, and not far away. Startled by the sight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
he stopped a moment and gazed intently at
them, striving to discover whether they wore
red coats or buff; but they were covered with
dust and he could not decide.</p>

<p>He quickly realized that he must act, and
he had just turned about, prepared to run
back in the road, when he heard several shots
fired at the approaching men from the woods
by the roadside.</p>

<p>The band instantly halted and prepared
to defend themselves. Without waiting to
watch the contest, he once more turned to
run, when he obtained a glimpse of men behind
him, partially concealed among the trees
and standing with their guns raised to their
shoulders, and with their attention fixed upon
the advancing soldiers.</p>

<p>Were the men friends or foes? Tom
could not determine; and, trembling with fear
and excitement, he stopped. He was between
the opposing bands, while off on his right it
was evident that other men were concealed.
Thoughts of the Mischianza and of the captain
with the unfortunate name were all gone
now. He could not advance; he dared not
retreat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TO REFUGEE TOWN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Little Peter re&euml;ntered the lonely
house after his friend Tom departed, the full
sense of his own sorrow for the first time
swept over him. Up to this time the necessity
of action had prevented him from fully
realizing his loss. The death of his mother,
the capture of his father, the provision he
was compelled to make at once for his
younger brothers and sisters, had so absorbed
his thoughts that he had had but little time
to dwell upon his own sorrow.</p>

<p>With the departure of Tom, however, there
came the reaction, and for a few moments
the heartbroken lad was almost overcome.
The very silence was oppressive. The only
sound he could hear was the loud and regular
ticking of the tall clock which stood in
one corner of the kitchen. How proud his
mother had always felt of that ancient timepiece!
Many a time had she told him of its
history and the pride with which she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
received it from her own father, when as a
young bride she had first entered the new
house which henceforth was to be hers. To
Peter, it almost seemed as if the stately clock
had been a member of the family, and its
voice was almost human to him. On the
summer afternoons, when he was a little
fellow and his mother had been busied in
her household duties, he had often stretched
himself upon the sanded floor, and, resting his
face upon his hands, with eager eyes had gazed
up into the face of the old timepiece and
listened to the swing of its long pendulum,
which for him had had a language all its own.</p>

<p>And now in the light of the early morning
the old clock still stood in the corner and
regularly ticked off the passing hours, as if
it were unmindful of all the sad scenes to
which it had recently been a witness. And yet
to Peter it almost seemed, too, as if there was
a tone of sadness after all in the monotonous
tickings that day. Perhaps the old clock
was striving to express its sympathy for the
sorrowing boy, but not even its sympathy
must be permitted to interfere with its duty
in marking the passage of the swiftly flying
minutes.</p>

<p>The few antiquated chairs were standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
just as they had stood when his mother had
been there. The brass-rimmed mirror, the
one ornament of the room, which hung over
the low mantelpiece, reflected the scene before
it, but in all the picture one figure was
wanting and would be forevermore. Overcome
by the full knowledge of his loss, Little
Peter bowed his head upon his hands and
leaned low upon the table, and burst into a
flood of tears&mdash;the first he had shed since
the sad event had occurred. Indian John was
forgotten, the few chores about the place
were ignored, and for a time the heartbroken
lad gave way to his sorrow for the loss of
his mother, upon whose face he never was to
look again.</p>

<p>How long he remained in that attitude he
did not know, but he was recalled to the
necessities of the present by the sound of
footsteps outside the door. His first thought
was that Indian John had returned, and he
hastily rose to greet him; but quickly he perceived
that the new-comer was not his Indian
friend, but Barzilla Giberson, one of his nearest
neighbors. If Little Peter had looked
carefully into his neighbor's face, he would
doubtless have noticed that the man was evidently
somewhat troubled, and apparently was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
not overjoyed at the prospect of an interview;
but the lad was too busied with his
own thoughts and sorrows to bestow a critical
examination upon a neighbor's countenance,
and Barzilla's evident uneasiness, therefore,
was all passed by unnoticed.</p>

<p>"Good-morrow to you, Little Peter," said
Barzilla. "The women folks wanted me to
come over and say to you that you were welcome
to make your home with them, if you so
chose."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Barzilla," replied Peter. "If
I were going to stay here I should be glad to
do that, but I'm going away this morning."</p>

<p>"Sho! Ye don't say so! Where ye goin',
if I may be so bold as to ask?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to look up my father."</p>

<p>"Where ye goin' to look him up?" said
Barzilla, somewhat uneasily.</p>

<p>"I'm going down to Refugee Town first.
I don't know what I'll do if I don't find him
there."</p>

<p>"Ye won't find him there," said Barzilla
quickly. "In course I don't know where he
is," he hastily added, "but I don't b'lieve
ye'll find him there; and, besides, that's no
place for a lad like you to go to alone, for I
take it ye're goin' alone?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I'm going alone," replied Peter, to
whom Barzilla's anxiety was not apparent.</p>

<p>"In course it isn't for me to say what ye
shall do and what ye shan't, but I don't
believe a trip there will do ye any good.
Ye've got to remember that other folks has
suffered, too. Yer marm isn't the only one
that's been shot, and yer pop isn't the only
man that's been carried off by the British."</p>

<p>"It wasn't the British that carried my
father away," said Peter quickly.</p>

<p>"'Twan't the British? Who was it then,
I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"'Twas Fenton and his band, that's who
it was."</p>

<p>"Sho! I can't believe that! I reckon
ye're mistaken, Peter. It must 'a' been the
redcoats."</p>

<p>"It was Fenton," repeated Peter decidedly.</p>

<p>"I can't b'lieve it," said Barzilla, rising as
he spoke. "I can't b'lieve it. However,
Peter, we'll look after yer place. The women
folks or I will do the chores for ye, while
ye're gone. It's only neighborly, ye know,
and what's friends good for if they can't
help in a time like this?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Peter quietly. "There
isn't much to be done, but if you'll look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
after what there is, I shall be glad. The
children are at Benzeor's house, you know."</p>

<p>"So I hear. So I hear. Well, they're in
good hands; ye can rest easy about that.
Well, I must be a-goin'. Ye still think ye'd
better go down to Refugee Town, do ye?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, good luck to ye. Good luck to ye.
We'll look after the place," called Barzilla as
he departed.</p>

<p>If Peter had gone to the door, he would
have discovered that Barzilla had not departed
to go to his own house, but that after he had
entered the road he had turned quickly and
started in the direction in which the Navesink
lay. But as Peter did not rise from his seat,
he missed all that, and, besides, in all probability
he would only have been puzzled by
his neighbor's actions and unable to account
for the haste with which he had made the
change.</p>

<p>Peter prepared his breakfast, and then
waited for the coming of Indian John. The
minutes passed, but the Indian did not put
in an appearance, and the lad began to suspect
that he would not return. At last, when
the sun had appeared, his suspicions passed
into certainty, and, resolving to wait for him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
no longer, he closed the house and started
resolutely on the path which led down to the
bank of the Navesink, where he kept his little
skiff concealed.</p>

<p>He soon arrived at the familiar place, and,
after taking his oars from their hiding-place
on the bank, pushed the little boat out into
the stream and began to row. The heat of
the morning soon began to make itself felt,
but Peter did not cease from his labors. He
was thinking of his father and where he
might then be. He was hoping that he would
be retained and sent to New York as a prisoner,
for Little Peter was well aware of the
value of the reward which was offered for
every prisoner taken; but Fenton, eager as
he was for money, was not likely to incur
any unnecessary risk for himself by keeping
any one near him who might prove to be a
source of danger. And Little Peter knew
that his father, especially after the recent
events, was not likely to be quiet. Of what
might then occur, the lad hardly dared to
think. He only knew that what he was to
do must be done quickly, if it was to avail,
and he rowed on and on without once stopping
for rest.</p>

<p>He had covered about half the distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
he was to go, when he heard a hail from
down the river. Hastily turning about at
the unexpected summons, he saw a little cat-boat
slowly coming up the river, and now not
many yards away.</p>

<p>"It's Benzeor Osburn," said Peter to himself,
as he obtained a glimpse of the man at
the helm. "But who's that with him? It's
Jacob Van Note. Yes, and that's Barzilla
Giberson, too. What in the world"&mdash;</p>

<p>His meditations were interrupted by Benzeor's
hail, "Where ye bound this mornin',
Little Peter? There's to be no lookout to-day,
is there?"</p>

<p>"I haven't heard of any," replied Peter,
looking at Barzilla and striving to understand
how it was that the man who had so recently
left his house could now be with Benzeor
sailing up the Navesink.</p>

<p>"I came down here after I left you," said
Barzilla, as if he felt that he must reply to
the question expressed in Peter's manner,
"and I fell in with Benzeor, so I stopped and
came back to tell him all about the doin's
that have been goin' on since he went away.
Benzeor's been gone from home two days
and more, ye know."</p>

<p>"Has he?" replied Peter. "No. I didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
know. Benzeor, the children are at your
house. Sarah said I could leave them there
and she'd look after them. If it isn't all
right, I'll take them away as soon as I come
back."</p>

<p>"It's all right. In course it's all right.
Barzilla here has been tellin' me about your
troubles. It's hard, Peter, but then ye know
that lots of people have been served the
same way. 'Misery loves company,' ye
know."</p>

<p>As Peter made no reply, Benzeor quickly
began to talk again, too quickly the lad
might have perceived, if he had not been so
filled with his own thoughts that all else
seemed to escape his observation. "Barzilla
tells me as how ye're goin' down to Refugee
Town to look up yer pop. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm tellin' ye it won't do any good.
He isn't there&mdash;leastwise, that is, I don't
believe he's there. In course I don't know
anything about it, but it stands to reason he
isn't. Ye'd better let me take yer skiff in
tow, as I've done with Barzilla's, and come
along back with us."</p>

<p>"I think I'll go on. If I don't find him
there I can report to Captain Dennis. Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
he'll be able to help me a bit, if it's
not too late."</p>

<p>Captain Dennis was in command of the
local militia, and he and his men already had
had several skirmishes with the pine robbers.
Indeed, the militia had been enrolled with
the very purpose of protecting the scattered
homes from the inroads of the outlaws and
refugees. Thus far, however, their efforts
had not met with a very marked success.</p>

<p>Peter did not observe the scowl which
crept over Benzeor's face at the mention of
the name of Captain Dennis. "Have it
your own way then," said the man gruffly.
"They say there's no fool like an old fool,
but for downright foolishness give me the
young fool every time. I'm tellin' ye that
ye won't find yer pop down at Refugee Town,
but ye'll have to find it out for yerself, I
suppose."</p>

<p>Surprised as Peter was at the abrupt change
in Benzeor's manner, his own purpose was
not changed, and without replying he picked
up his oars and began to row again. He
could see the men in earnest conversation as
he drew away from them, but it had not yet
entered his thoughts that anything could be
wrong with them. He was puzzled to account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
for Barzilla's unexpected presence, but
his offer to look after his home in his absence
was still fresh in his mind, and left no room
for suspicion.</p>

<p>As for Benzeor, Little Peter knew that he
was considered as a strange man,&mdash;"odd,"
the country people termed it,&mdash;and he gave
little heed to him or his words. His one
purpose now was to go to Refugee Town.
He had but little fear of meeting the men
who had assembled there, although he knew
they were all desperate and reckless. They
would not harm him, he thought, and it was
possible that he might find his father there,
or learn of his whereabouts. Just what he
would do if he should find him, he did not
know. In any event, he would be with him
again, and if he was to be sent as a prisoner
to the sugar-house in New York, or to the
Whitby or the Jersey, at least his captivity
might be shared.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Little Peter rowed steadily
forward and in the course of an hour arrived
at the mouth of the Navesink. Then he
landed and hauled his skiff up on the shore,
striving to conceal it among the bushes which
grew there. It was only a mile now across
the sandy strip to the shore of the ocean, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the lad began to walk rapidly. Refugee
Town was not far away, and the end of his
journey would soon be gained.</p>

<p>The heat of the sun was now intense.
Across the sands he could see eddies in the
heated air, and he felt as if he were breathing
the blasts from an oven. His face was
streaming with perspiration, while the touch
of the sand beneath his feet seemed almost as
if it would blister them.</p>

<p>He soon arrived at a place from which he
could look out upon the ocean, and it was
with a sigh of relief he felt its first cool
breath upon his face. Refugee Town now
was not far away, so he began to run.</p>

<p>He stopped as he saw two gunboats riding
at anchor about a quarter of a mile out from
the shore. What could it all mean? They
were British vessels, their flags disclosed that;
but what was their purpose in casting their
anchors there?</p>

<p>He was upon the beach now, and stopped
for a moment to gaze at the graceful vessels.
He thought he could almost make out the
figures of the sailors on the deck. And a
little boat was just approaching the larger
of the gunboats. Doubtless it had been
ashore and was now returning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"How!"</p>

<p>Peter turned suddenly as he heard the
exclamation, and saw Indian John standing
before him. His alarm subsided as he recognized
his friend, and he said reprovingly, "I
thought you were going to go with me this
morning, John. Why didn't you?"</p>

<p>"John been. Go to 'Gee Town. No fader
there."</p>

<p>"What, my father isn't there? Are you
sure, John?"</p>

<p>The Indian made no reply, evidently considering
his first words sufficient. He was
gazing intently at the boats in the distance,
and Little Peter almost unconsciously turned
and followed his look. At first he could discover
nothing to indicate what had interested
his companion; but he soon saw that the
little boat, which he had thought was returning
to the gunboat, was coming to the shore.
Startled by the sight, he was about to inquire
of John whether he knew anything concerning
the vessels, when he heard a shout.</p>

<p>At a distance of a hundred yards up the
beach he saw a motley crowd approaching.
Negroes and poorly clad men were among
them, and the appearance of all revealed that
they were doubtless from Refugee Town.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Their own presence was discovered at the
same time, and a shout greeted them.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Indian John quickly; and
in an instant Little Peter obeyed, and both
were running swiftly over the sand along the
beach.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 304px;">
<img src="images/illus163.jpg" width="304" height="500" alt="&quot;THEY&#39;RE AFTER US, JOHN!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THEY&#39;RE AFTER US, JOHN!&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>Their flight was greeted by another shout
from the men behind them, and one or two
guns were discharged, but the bullets passed
harmlessly over the heads of the fugitives.
One glance, however, showed Peter that some
of the men had started in pursuit.</p>

<p>"They're after us, John!" he said in a
low voice to his companion.</p>

<p>Instantly increasing their efforts, they sped
swiftly on in their flight, but the shouts,
which were now redoubled, betrayed that the
pursuit had not been abandoned. On and
on ran pursuers and pursued, while at intervals
a gun was discharged and the calls and
shouts could be distinctly heard.</p>



<p>For a half mile the flight had continued,
and Peter was beginning to feel that he could
go no farther. The hot air of the summer
morning, the burning sand beneath his feet,
as well as the weariness arising from his previous
exertions, combined to sap his strength.
His breath was coming in gasps now, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
down his face the perspiration was pouring
in streams. He felt that he could go no
farther.</p>

<p>Another glance behind him showed that
the men had not abandoned the pursuit. A
half dozen of them were still running swiftly
along the beach, and to Little Peter it seemed
as if they were gaining upon him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BATHSHEBA'S FEAST</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Indian John</span> had been slightly changing
the direction in which they were running,
although Little Peter had not perceived the
change. At first they had kept close to
the water's edge, and at times the creeping
tide had rolled up to their feet. As his companion
had gradually drawn closer to the
higher ridge which extended somewhat farther
back from the beach, Peter had thought
nothing of the slight divergence, except that
the Indian was desirous of keeping a little
farther from the water.</p>

<p>Along this ridge in advance of him, Peter
saw that thick bushes and stunted trees were
growing, and he thought of the possibility of
finding some hiding-place there; but he was
hardly prepared for the change which Indian
John then made. They had just passed a
bend in the ridge which shut out the view
of their pursuers, and come to a little gully
which the winter storms had in the course of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
many years cut deep into the bank. Here
Indian John turned sharply, and, bidding his
companion follow him, turned directly into
the woods, which extended from the shore
far back into the adjoining country.</p>

<p>Little Peter instantly followed, but they
had not gone many yards before they came
suddenly upon a wigwam in the midst of the
forest. Indian John stopped, and, after a
few hurried words with the Indian who was
standing near and who had silently watched
the approaching fugitives, beckoned for Peter
to follow him, and both entered the conical
shaped dwelling and threw themselves upon
the ground.</p>

<p>The lad was so thankful for the respite,
and was so nearly exhausted by his efforts,
that for a time he said nothing, being only
too glad of an opportunity to rest. Every
moment he expected to hear the voices of their
pursuers, and more than once was on the
point of starting forth from the hut and
resuming his flight, so certain was he that
the men had discovered the hiding-place.</p>

<p>After a time he was positive that he was
not deceived. He could hear the voices of
men in conversation with the Indians, and all
of his fears returned. His companion placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
his hand upon the arm of the trembling lad,
and Peter waited, listening intently, and fearful
every moment that some one would enter
the hut and summon them to come forth.</p>

<p>The conversation lasted several minutes,
and then abruptly ceased. Peter could not
determine whether the strangers had departed
or not; but he waited anxiously and did not
speak.</p>

<p>The moments slowly passed and his suspense
increased. It seemed to him that he
must escape from the place in which he was
concealed. The very air was strangely oppressive,
and the ignorance as to what was
going on outside the wigwam increased the
anxiety of the frightened boy.</p>

<p>He did not know where he was, nor who
were the people whose abode Indian John
had so unceremoniously entered. No voice
within or without the hut could now be
heard, and the silence itself added to his
alarm.</p>

<p>He could see that Indian John was seated
upon the ground with his head resting upon
his knees. He had not moved nor changed
his position since they had entered. Motionless
as a statue he remained seated, as if he
were utterly unmindful of all about him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"John!" whispered Little Peter at last.</p>

<p>The Indian raised his head and looked at
his companion, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"John, don't you think we'd better start
on again?"</p>

<p>Indian John still made no reply, and his
head dropped again upon his knees. Peter
then perceived that his companion intended
neither to speak nor to depart, and that he
must wait in silence for him to explain his
purpose, or to act.</p>

<p>The impatient lad endeavored to possess
his soul in patience, but as the moments
passed his anxiety and fear increased. The
uncertainty, he thought, was even more difficult
to be borne than was the pursuit itself,
for action of some kind was then possible,
while this waiting in silence was almost unbearable.
Not a sound could now be heard.
The very birds were silent under the burning
heat of the noontime, and the grating
notes of the crickets had ceased.</p>

<p>At last it seemed to him he could bear it
no longer, and he was about to arise and
go forth from the hut, regardless of consequences,
when some one entered and spoke a
few words in an unknown tongue to Indian
John.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come," said the Indian gently, standing
erect as he spoke; and Little Peter at once
followed him out into the open air.</p>

<p>He glanced quickly about him, but no one
was to be seen except three Indians, one of
whom was a man, and the others, two women.
Little Peter instantly recognized them as
Moluss, or "Charlie" Moluss, as many of the
whites called him, and his wife and her sister.</p>

<p>The two women were busily engaged in
preparing the contents of a small iron vessel,
which was hanging from a stick supported
by two forked branches, driven into the
ground, and beneath which a brisk fire was
burning.</p>

<p>One of the women was feeding the fire,
while the other was stirring the contents of
the hanging pot. A savory odor greeted
Little Peter's nostrils, and as soon as he perceived
that he was in no immediate danger
he realized that he was hungry; and, with the
passing of his alarm, there came an eager
interest in the occupation of the two women
before him.</p>

<p>Little Peter had seen the trio many times
before this. They had their home with
others of their tribe in a little settlement
several miles back in the interior. This settlement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
was commonly known as Edgepelick,
or Edge Pillock, and to it the Indians had
gradually withdrawn after they had disposed
of their lands, for the good people of Old
Monmouth were as scrupulous as their New
England cousins in not taking the lands from
the dusky owners without giving a so-called
equivalent for them.</p>

<p>It is true that this "equivalent" sometimes
was a barrel of cider, or a piece of bright-colored
cloth; but perhaps the Indians thought
that was better than nothing, and as their
lands were certain to be taken from them,
even such an equivalent as that which was
offered was not to be despised, and so they
had submitted to the unequal exchange. At
all events, the exchanges had been made, and
in the summer of 1778, many of the Indian
families were dwelling in Edge Pillock, and
there continued to reside until the year 1802,
when the men who had driven such shrewd
bargains with them caused them all to be
removed to Oneida Lake, in the neighboring
State of New York.</p>

<p>Charlie Moluss, with his wife and her sister,
had been frequent visitors in Little Peter's
home, and he knew them almost as well as he
did Indian John. Somehow, they had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
been content to abide continuously in Edge
Pillock, and at least twice each year came
down to the shore, where they erected a wigwam,
and while Moluss fished and gathered
oysters and clams, the women made baskets
and sold them among the scattered homes of
the settlers. Doubtless this, then, was their
annual visit, thought Little Peter, and their
abiding place had been known to Indian John,
who had sought its shelter as a place of
refuge from their pursuers. And Little Peter
was quite content, at least for the present,
and his feeling of relief was not diminished
by the savory odor which now arose from the
iron vessel.</p>

<p>Charlie Moluss's wife was a strikingly
handsome Indian woman, and was known as
Bathsheba, which the irreverent settlers had
shortened into "Bath," as they had her
sister's name into "Suke."</p>

<p>Bathsheba was considered as an Indian
queen, and the respect which the Indians
showed her was, to a certain extent, shared by
the white people, especially by the Quakers.
She was regarded as a highly intelligent
woman, and the most prominent people of
the region were always glad to welcome her
to their homes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Peter thought of all these things as
he seated himself upon the ground beside
the two men, who were, apparently, as deeply
interested in the occupation of the women as
was he, himself. The work went steadily on,
and, while Peter found that his hunger was
increasing, he nevertheless listened to what
Indian John told him of Moluss's success in
turning their pursuers back to their camp at
Refugee Town. Some of them had followed
the fugitives as far as the wigwam, but had
turned away after the Indian had professed
his inability to give them the information
they desired, and, doubtless, before this time,
were safely back in "'Gee Town," as Indian
John termed their little settlement by the
Hook.</p>

<p>Just why they had been pursued Indian
John could not explain, but he had connected
it in some way with the appearance of the
boat off the shore, and Little Peter was not
inclined to differ from his conclusion. He
was satisfied now that his father was not to
be found in Refugee Town, and he had decided
to go farther down the shore to the
place where he thought he would be likely
to find Captain Dennis, or some of the local
militia who had been stationed near to protect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the salt works and strive to hold back the
pine robbers, many of whom had their places
of concealment not far away.</p>

<p>Just at present, however, the thought of
his dinner was uppermost in his mind. He
eagerly watched Bathsheba and her sister in
their work, and, from their movements, he
concluded that his waiting time was soon to
end. One of the women entered the wigwam
and brought out several small wooden bowls.
Into these she dipped some of the steaming
contents of the iron vessel, placing each bowl
upon the ground when it had been filled.</p>

<p>A word from Bathsheba caused Moluss to
arise, and, approaching the fire, he took one
of the bowls in both hands and then seated
himself upon the ground and proceeded to
blow with his breath upon the soup, preparatory
to drinking it.</p>

<p>His example was speedily followed by Indian
John and Little Peter, who took their bowls
and seated themselves beside Moluss on the
ground. An expression of deep satisfaction
was manifest upon the faces of the two men,
while the women, apparently proud of their
success in the culinary art, looked on with
evident pleasure. Little Peter also raised the
bowl in his hands and blew upon it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!" said Moluss, taking a long
draught. "Good hop! Hop good!"</p>

<p>"Good!" muttered Indian John, following
his friend's example. "Good hop! Good
hop!"</p>

<p>"What?" said Little Peter suddenly, placing
his bowl again on the ground before him
as he spoke. "What was that you said,
John?"</p>

<p>"Good! Good hop," replied the Indian,
with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that hop-toads
are in this soup, do you?"</p>

<p>"Um!" replied Indian John, with a grunt
of pleasure. "Good! Little hop-hop! John
like um! Good hop! John like um little
hop-hop!" And, suiting the action to the
word, he proceeded to take a deeper draught
of the savory mixture.</p>

<p>All of Little Peter's hunger, however, had
disappeared. He quickly arose from his seat,
and, with an expression of disgust upon his
face, which he could not entirely repress, prepared
to pass the group and go into the forest.</p>

<p>A loud laugh greeted his action, and as he
passed Moluss, the Indian held forth his bowl,
and said, "Peter like um hop-hop? Good!
Moluss like um hop-hop! John like um hop-hop!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Squaw like um hop-hop! All like um
hop-hop! All like um hop-hop! Peter like
um, too?"</p>

<p>Little Peter was not to be tempted, and the
broad grin upon the faces of the women, as
well as the loud laugh of the men which followed
him as he turned into the forest, did
not tend to overcome his feeling of disgust.
How was it possible that they could be willing
to eat such filthy creatures as hop-toads?
Little Peter was all in ignorance of some of
the dainty viands which, under high-sounding
names, are served up in our modern restaurants,
and so, as a matter of course, could
draw no comparison between the tastes of
the rude, uncivilized savages and those of the
more highly cultivated men of our own times.
Perhaps he would not have compared them
if he had been possessed of the prophet's
foresight. He knew, however, that his own
hunger had disappeared, and as he walked on
he found many excuses for his uncivilized
friends. They were welcome to their own
customs, but they must not expect him to join
them in their feasts.</p>

<p>He had gone so far from the wigwam by
this time that he thought the repast, which
had so highly delighted his friends, would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
be ended by the time he could walk back.
Accordingly, he reversed his steps, but as he
walked on his own pressing problem returned
in full force.</p>

<p>His father was not to be found in Refugee
Town, of that he felt certain; for, while Indian
John had not said much, he knew him
so well that he was satisfied he had known
whereof he had spoken.</p>

<p>Where, then, could he be? It was currently
reported that Fenton's band had a
place in the lower part of the county, to
which they carried their booty and from which
they started forth on their raids. It was just
possible that his father had been taken there
by the outlaws in their flight, but he would
not long be retained there. Fenton knew
what American prisoners were worth in the
New York market, and, doubtless, he would
find some means by which he could send him
there. And the pine robber would act soon,
too, for with the approach of the armies, there
would be many opportunities for his own special
work, and he would not long be hampered
by the presence of a single prisoner, whose
value would be slight compared with that of
the plunder he might secure.</p>

<p>Little Peter decided that what he was to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
he must do quickly. He would start at once
for the place where Captain Dennis's men
were said to be, and place the entire matter
in their hands. The captain was a man whose
bravery was well known in Old Monmouth,
and he was ever ready to aid the scattered
settlers.</p>

<p>Captain Dennis would surely help him, too,
Peter thought, and, with his heart somewhat
lightened, he began to walk more rapidly.
He would return to the wigwam and inform
Indian John of his decision. If John would
go with him, he would be glad of his aid,
but, whether he went or not, the lad felt that
his own problem was, in a measure, already
solved.</p>

<p>"Little Peter, is that you?"</p>

<p>The startled lad looked up quickly at the
unexpected summons, and saw, standing directly
in his pathway, nine men. Each had a
musket in his hands, but they wore no uniforms,
and for a moment Little Peter could
not determine whether they were friends or
foes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WITH THE REDCOATS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fear in Tom Coward's heart, when he
discovered that he was between the lines of
the soldiers, made him almost desperate. The
men before him already had raised their guns,
and at any moment he expected to hear their
report. When he had glanced behind him
he had seen that the men there were also prepared
to shoot, and he was in a position where
he was likely to receive the discharges of both
sides.</p>

<p>Along by the side of the road was a deep
ditch, which had been worn by the spring
floods. Just at present there was no water
in it, and Tom instantly threw himself upon
the ground, and, still grasping his gun, rolled
toward the place. As he slipped over the
side he heard the discharge of the guns, and
his heart almost stood still in his terror. The
bullets, however, had all gone over his head,
and the lad was unharmed, although he was
so frightened that even the thoughts of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
own personal safety were almost driven from
his mind.</p>

<p>Shouts and calls followed the discharge of
the guns, and then there was a rush of men
past the place in which he was lying. From
the direction from which the men had come,
Tom concluded that those who were behind
him had fled, and that the others were in
swift pursuit of them. He did not dare to
raise his head, nor try to obtain a glimpse of
the combatants, but lay still in his hiding-place,
hoping that in the excitement his presence
would not be discovered. The shouts
continued, but as they sounded farther and
farther away, the trembling lad concluded
that pursuers and pursued must have turned
the bend in the road. If they kept on, he
would soon be able to crawl forth from the
ditch, he thought, and in the woods would
find some place in which he might remain
until all the immediate danger had passed.</p>

<p>Still, he did not yet dare to leave his
hiding-place, and, as the moments passed,
his own fears and anxiety were not allayed.
His face and hands were covered with the
mud which had clung to them when he had
slid into the ditch. The mosquitoes gathered
about him, and, do what he would, he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
not drive off the tormenting little pests. The
sultriness which had followed the brief storm
was almost unbearable, and Tom felt as if he
could not have selected a worse place in which
to conceal himself. There had not been
much of any "selecting" about it, he grimly
thought, for he had crawled into the first
shelter that presented itself. A place in the
muddy ditch was to be preferred to one in
the middle of the road, and between two contending
bands of soldiers. Here the bullets
were not likely to find him, at least for the
present, and his only hope depended upon
the possibility of his presence not having
been heeded. Perhaps the soldiers in either
band had been so intent upon watching what
the others would do, that a frightened lad
between their lines would not be discovered.</p>

<p>This hope was not strong enough to induce
him to leave his shelter, and he decided
to remain in the ditch until he was satisfied
that all danger was past. The moments
dragged on, and the silence which had followed
the brief contest was unbroken. The
heat was becoming more and more intense,
and Tom felt that he could not remain much
longer in his present position. Still, he
waited and listened, but the sound of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
cawing crows was all that he could hear. He
counted off the minutes, and when what he
judged must be an hour had passed, he concluded
to remain there no longer. The men
had not been heard in all that time, and
doubtless must have disappeared from the
immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>The sight of the men had shown Tom that
he was nearer the army than he had supposed.
For a moment the thought of his
former eager desire to join it came into his
mind, and when he contrasted his feelings
then with those he now had, his present position
seemed almost ludicrous. Bespattered
with mud, hiding in a ditch by the roadside,
in constant fear of the return of the men,
he certainly did not present the appearance
of a very brave young soldier. Even Tom
smiled as he thought of all this, but he was
wiser than he had been a few days before
this time, and the sound of guns was not
exactly like that of which he had dreamed.</p>

<p>Tom Coward was not lacking in bravery,
however, but the position in which he had
found himself certainly was a trying one,
and perhaps the boldest of us might have
done no better had we been caught in his
predicament.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The time had now come, he thought, when
it must be safe for him to venture out upon
the road again, and, grasping his gun, he
prepared to climb out of the ditch, when he
suddenly paused as he thought he heard the
sound of voices once more.</p>

<p>Yes, there could be no mistake about it;
the men were approaching from the direction
in which both bands had disappeared.</p>

<p>He crouched lower and waited for them to
pass. If they were foes, it certainly would
be wiser, as well as safer, for him not to
attract their attention; and if they were
friends he was hardly in a condition to present
himself before them.</p>

<p>The men were coming nearer, and were
almost opposite his hiding-place now. The
lad's excitement returned, and he leaned
harder against the muddy bank. It seemed
to him as if the loud beatings of his heart
would betray him.</p>

<p>The band had halted, and were within a
few feet of the ditch. What could it mean?
Had his hiding-place been discovered? He
crouched still lower, and did not once look
up. He clutched his gun in his hands as if
he thought he could lean upon that. The
suspense was intense, and almost unbearable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello! Here's some one in the ditch!"</p>

<p>Tom's heart sank, and, as he glanced
hastily upward, he saw a redcoated soldier
peering down at him. The end had come,
and all his efforts to conceal himself had
been in vain.</p>

<p>"The fellow's alive," exclaimed the soldier
in surprise. "Come up out of that and give
an account of yourself!"</p>

<p>Tom obeyed, and, crawling up the bank,
stood facing the men. There were thirty-five
or forty of them, and, as he saw that
they were clad in the British uniform, he
realized that he was in the presence of the
enemy. The suspense, at least, was ended
now, and, as he glanced at the soldiers, in
spite of the fact that he was well aware of
his danger, much of his alarm had disappeared,
for Tom Coward was not unlike
others in being stronger to face the actual
condition than the uncertainty which is connected
with the approach of perils.</p>

<p>The men glanced curiously at him a moment
and then burst into a loud laugh. The
troubled boy at first could not discover the
cause of their merriment, but as he glanced
at his hands and saw that they were covered
with the mud which was not yet dry, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
realized that doubtless his face and clothing
were in the same condition. And Tom's
appearance was not very prepossessing at that
moment. His hat was gone, his face was so
completely covered with mud that any one
would have had difficulty in deciding whether
he was white or black, and his bearing was
far from being bold.</p>

<p>The laughter of the men continued until
an officer approached and said, "Who are
you? What were you hiding for?"</p>

<p>Tom hesitated a moment, and then replied,
"I was trying to keep out of the way of your
bullets."</p>

<p>Again the soldiers laughed, and the officer
said, "You didn't differ very much from the
other fellows in the band, although they took
to the woods and you to the ditch."</p>

<p>"What band?"</p>

<p>"Why, those men of Dickinson's we've
just driven away. You don't mean to say
that you didn't belong to them?"</p>

<p>"I didn't belong to any band," said Tom
slowly. "I was just coming across the country,
and when I stepped out into the road I
found I was right between you and the other
fellows. I crawled into the ditch, for I was
afraid that both of you would hit me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite right, my lad, quite right. But
how does it happen that you carry a rifle?
The most of the Yankees are glad enough
to get muskets, and here you are traveling
round the country with a rifle. I'm afraid
your story won't do, my lad. We'll have to
take you along with us, and let you tell your
story to the colonel."</p>

<p>Tom perceived that any further protest on
his part would be useless, and, as the word
to advance was at once given, he obediently
took his place in the ranks and marched on
with the men.</p>

<p>The heat was so intense that they were
compelled to halt frequently for rests. A
few of the men evidently were Hessians, and
their high jack-boots, their heavy fur hats, as
well as the short broadswords they carried, in
addition to the short guns or carbines which
were slung over their shoulders, seemed sadly
out of place under the burning heat of the
summer day. Tom did not know how the
British officers had protested against the customs
of their allies, so unsuitable in the country
in which they were fighting; but the
men from Hesse were obstinate, and, firmly
believing that the equipment which had been
good enough for them in the old country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
would certainly be good enough in the new,
clung to the uncomfortable garments and
unwieldy arms, unmindful alike of the jeers
of their comrades in arms and the danger
they incurred by the use of them.</p>

<p>In the course of two hours the band arrived
at a little camp in command of a man whom
the leader addressed as Colonel Simcoe. Tom
was at once summoned by him and taken into
the presence of the colonel, or lieutenant-colonel,
as he then really was.</p>

<p>"What have you here?" inquired the
colonel, glancing at Tom as he spoke.</p>

<p>"We picked this fellow out of a ditch
back here. We had a little brush with a
band of Dickinson's men, but they didn't
wait for us. We chased them a mile or two
up the road; but the day was so warm, and
as the rebels took to the woods, we soon gave
it up and came back. We found this fellow
on our return. He claims he doesn't belong
to the rebels; but as we found that he carried
a rifle, we thought best to bring him
into camp with us. We didn't know but
he might be able to give you some of the
information you wanted just now."</p>

<p>"You did right, lieutenant. I'll talk with
him later. Now tell me what you learned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Did you hear anything more about Washington?
How are the roads and the bridges?"</p>

<p>"The rebels have been tearing up the
bridges, and Dickinson has a good many of
the militia scattered along in the woods. I
rather suspect they are planning to serve us
as the countrymen served Lord Percy up at
Lexington."</p>

<p>"I fancy we shall be able to put a stop to
that, though your report is much like that
which I have found out myself. Did you
hear anything more of Washington?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't get a word out of anybody.
I don't believe he's moved from the position
he held yesterday, though."</p>

<p>For several minutes the men conversed, and
when at last the younger officer departed,
Colonel Simcoe turned to Tom and said,
"Now, my lad, I'll listen to your story."</p>

<p>"I haven't any story," replied Tom. "I
was coming through the woods back here, and
when I stepped out into the road I found myself
right between the two bands, and as I was
afraid I'd be caught by the fire of both of
them, I crawled into the ditch to be out of
the way. That's why I'm covered with this
dirt," he added apologetically.</p>

<p>"You don't need any one to confirm your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
words as to that," said the colonel, smiling
slightly, as he spoke, at Tom's appearance.
"Now what I want to know is who you are
and what you were doing with a rifle? Few
people here carry rifles, I find."</p>

<p>Tom hesitated a moment, not knowing just
what to say in reply to the question. The
colonel was watching him intently, and the
lad felt that he must say something. "I live
back here," he said at last. "I've lived in
Old Monmouth all my life. I'd started out
from home to go to&mdash;to&mdash;to some of my
friends, and, as I told you, I got caught between
the lines."</p>

<p>"How about the rifle?"</p>

<p>"My father had the other guns and I had
to take that. The last thing he told me was
to take a gun and scare the blackbirds and
crows from the ten-acre lot."</p>

<p>"Is your father a loyalist?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's good; and now if you can answer
my questions, perhaps I'll be inclined to let
you go. You say you've lived here all your
life. Do you know all the roads and bridges?
Could you find your way anywhere in the
county?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I think I could."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me about the bridges. Have many
of them been torn up?"</p>

<p>Tom did not know, but he thought of his
meeting with young Lieutenant Gordon that
morning, and boldly answered, "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How does it happen that your good
father and the other loyalists permit that?"</p>

<p>"My father's not at home, and there are
too many of the pa&mdash;of the rebels."</p>

<p>"I thought you told me your father sent
you out with your gun," said the colonel
quickly. "How is that? How could he
send you if he wasn't at home?"</p>

<p>"He sent me before he left," replied Tom,
his voice trembling in spite of his efforts to
control it.</p>

<p>"Do you know where Washington is?"
inquired the colonel abruptly.</p>

<p>"I hear he's up by Hopewell. I don't
know." Tom might have added that he
would be glad to learn, but his wish was not
expressed.</p>

<p>"That's right. He <i>is</i> at Hopewell. Is
there any talk about his plans? Have you
heard of any rumors among the rebels as to
what he plans to do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I hear he is planning to fall on
Clinton's baggage train."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir Henry Clinton, you mean, I suppose,"
said the colonel sharply. "Do you think
you could find your way from here to Cranberry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you know every road?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I shall expect you to go
with a party to-night and show them the
way."</p>

<p>"But," protested Tom, "I thought you
said I could go if I answered your questions."</p>

<p>"You'll have to stay now. Your father's
a good loyalist, you say, and he'll not object
to his son's remaining here for a day or
two and serving as a guide. I'll see that
you have some supper and are ready to start
before it's dark."</p>

<p>Tom left the colonel's presence, and with
a heavy heart turned to look about the little
camp.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE WAY TO CRANBERRY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late in the evening when Tom
started from Colonel Simcoe's camp in company
with the lieutenant, whose name he had
learned was Ward, and the band of six men.
A hearty supper had greatly refreshed the
weary lad, and although he was aware that
his companions were not without suspicions
of him, he still had hopes that he would be
able to convince them of his knowledge of
the country roads, and then could leave them.
His efforts to convince the colonel that he
was merely a country lad, who had taken no
part in the hostilities, had not been without a
measure of success, and if they met with no
mishap on the road, doubtless they would be
willing for him to depart.</p>

<p>As to leading the little band into Cranberry,
Tom had not the slightest objection to
that, for it would be going directly toward
the place where Washington's army lay, and
every step was one nearer the men whom he
was most eager to join.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The entire party were mounted, and a
horse was also provided for Tom. To be
sure, the steed was not a remarkable one, yet,
as the lad looked him over before he mounted,
he was satisfied that riding would be much
easier than walking, and of walking Tom had
had sufficient, he thought, on that hot June
morning.</p>

<p>"Now, my lad," said Lieutenant Ward, as
the party prepared to move, "if you do well
by us this night, I have two half joes for
you in my pocket. On the other hand, if you
fail us, or try to lead us into any trap, you
shall have a good taste of the lead my men
carry, or know how it feels to dance at one
end of a rope with your feet a good yard
from the ground. You hear what I'm saying,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Tom replied. "I can lead you
straight to Cranberry, but of course I can't
tell what men we shall meet on the way. All
I know is that General Dickinson has men out,
just as you have."</p>

<p>"Never mind your 'General' Dickinson.
I only wish we might have the good fortune
to meet the rebel himself. You show us the
way and we'll look after any of his men we
may fall in with. All we want of you is to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
show us the way. They won't be likely to
be out on the road in the night."</p>

<p>Tom by no means felt so positive concerning
that as the lieutenant did, but the word
to start was then given, and mounting his
horse he departed from the camp with the
men.</p>

<p>The moon was now full and hung low in
the heavens like a great ball of fire. The
frogs in the swamps were croaking loudly as
the men rode past. The air of the summer
night was almost motionless, and the heat
of the day had only slightly decreased with
the coming of the darkness. In all his life
in Jersey, Tom had never known a hotter
"spell"&mdash;as the natives termed it&mdash;than
they had experienced during the past few
days. A Hessian was riding beside him, and
Tom could not understand how it was that he
still insisted upon wearing the heavy fur hat
in such weather.</p>

<p>So intensely warm was the night that the
band were compelled to halt at frequent
intervals to rest their dripping steeds. The
occasional breeze was like the hot breath from
an oven, and, in spite of the fact that he was
riding, Tom's face was wet with perspiration.
The progress was necessarily slow, but the lad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
soon came to Doctor's Creek, and as they
found the bridge across that stream intact,
the lieutenant was pleased and warmly praised
the young guide.</p>

<p>The Assanpink Creek was crossed not long
afterwards, and as the bridge across that also
was still standing, the elation of the leader
was visibly increased and he ordered the men
to halt for another rest. Some without removing
their clothing waded into the stream,
which was narrow and shallow where they were,
and led their horses in after them. The heaving
sides of the poor beasts were wet with
sweat and foam, and the men themselves
seemed to be but little better. Tom thought
he had never suffered more from the heat.</p>

<p>After a rest of a half hour the men resumed
their journey. Thus far no one had been
met on the road, and the confidence of the
band was steadily increasing, in spite of the
fact that they were approaching the region in
which the American army was supposed to be.</p>

<p>Five miles farther on they came to Rocky
Branch and the bridge over this stream was
as strong and safe as those they had left
behind them.</p>

<p>"The half joes are likely to be yours, my
boy," said the lieutenant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom made no reply, for he was thinking
that something beside safe bridges might be
discovered before they arrived at their destination.
Only one more stream remained to
be crossed, and then they would be in Cranberry.
Just where they were then to go, or
what was to be done, Tom did not know.
Not a word had been spoken to him concerning
the object of the expedition, and all that
he was expected to do was to lead the band
to Cranberry.</p>

<p>"How much farther have we to go, my
boy?" inquired the leader.</p>

<p>"That depends upon the place you've
started for," replied Tom. "We shall be in
Cranberry after we've gone about ten miles
farther, but it covers a good many miles.
The township is a big one."</p>

<p>"We'll decide that after we get there.
Have we any more streams to cross?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The Millstone river isn't very far
away now."</p>

<p>The rests had become so frequent that
morning could not be far away, Tom thought.
With the appearance of the sun their dangers
were likely to be increased, but he made no
mention of the fears in his heart, and the
band soon started on again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>When they arrived at the Millstone, the
first break in the success of the expedition
was found, for the bridge was down. This
plainly showed that the Americans were not
far distant now, and as the lieutenant drew
rein on his horse, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This means that Sir Henry will find difficulty
in getting his baggage train across here.
Do you know whether the stream can be
forded?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tom, pointing as he spoke
to a place a little farther down the stream.
"We can wade our horses across there."</p>

<p>"But can the baggage wagons be driven
through?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot say. I think not."</p>

<p>"We'll soon find out," said the lieutenant,
leading the way to the ford.</p>

<p>The men all followed him, but as the
water came well up to their horses' flanks, it
was at once evident that Clinton would find
great difficulty in getting his baggage train
across. The party halted near the bank
after they had crossed the stream, and the
lieutenant had an earnest conversation with
one of his men.</p>

<p>Tom could not hear their words, but he
had no doubt that they were discussing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
possibilities of Clinton's march by the way
they had come that night.</p>

<p>"We'll go on a bit farther," said the
lieutenant at last, and the men obediently
mounted and followed their leader.</p>

<p>The gray of the dawn had just appeared
in the east, and the air was filled with the
songs of the birds. They were now in the
township of Cranberry, and the end of their
journey could not be far away, Tom thought,
although he did not know what that end was
to be. Thus far they had come without
trouble, but with the coming of the morning,
and their proximity to the American army,
their difficulties were likely soon to be increased.</p>

<p>The men were silent as they rode slowly
forward, and were keeping a constant watch
on every side. The sun by this time had
made its appearance, and the day gave promise
of being even warmer than the preceding
one. Before them they could see two rude
little houses on opposite sides of the road
and at the end of lanes which led back from
the roadside. The one on the left Tom instantly
recognized as the abode of a Quaker
named Nathan Brown, or "Friend Nathan,"
as his neighbors called him. Many a time had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Tom been there, and even then he recalled
many of the quaint expressions of the gentle
man who had steadily opposed all the hostilities,
in accordance with his creed which
forbade even the resistance to tyrants.</p>

<p>As the lieutenant saw the two houses he
drew the rein on his horse, and the party
halted.</p>

<p>"It's time we had some breakfast," he
said. "I am wondering whether we can't
find something here in these houses. Do you
know anything about them, my lad?"</p>

<p>"I know the man that lives in the house
on the left. He is a Quaker," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"All the better for us. I think I'll let
you go up to his house, and I'll send a man
up to the other. The rest of us had better
stay here and keep watch, for there may be
some prowling rebels around here, for all that
we may know."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Tom quickly. "But I can
leave you then, can't I? We're in Cranberry
now and all you wanted of me was
to lead you there."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you wish," replied the lieutenant.
"You've done well, but you'd do better
still to go back with us. The rebels are
not far away, and you may get into trouble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
You must do as you like, though," he added.
"You've earned your pay," and he drew the
two half joes from his pocket and handed
them to Tom.</p>

<p>The lad received the money, no small
amount to him, and, after thanking the lieutenant,
started quickly up the lane which led
to Nathan's house. As he glanced behind
him, he perceived that one of the men had
started towards the other house, while all the
others had dismounted and were still in the
road, although they evidently were keeping a
careful watch.</p>

<p>When Tom drew near the house he saw
the Quaker standing in the doorway. His
broad-brimmed hat and the peaceful expression
upon his face were in marked contrast to
the warlike men he had just left behind him
in the road.</p>

<p>"How now?" said Nathan, as he perceived
who the approaching man was. "Thee
travels early, Friend Thomas; I trust all is
well at thy house."</p>

<p>Tom quickly dismounted, and in a few
words explained how it was that he happened
to be there, and what the purpose of his visit
was.</p>

<p>"Thee doesn't say so!" said Nathan in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
surprise. "And the redcoats even now are at
my door and seek refreshment?"</p>

<p>"They are out in the road. They want
some breakfast, and I think they'll pay you
for it."</p>

<p>"Friend Thomas, I think I can trust thee.
I have known thee since thou wert a little
lad. Ah, these are sad times for men of
peace! The sons of Belial are on all sides.
Verily, these days are days of wrath."</p>

<p>Tom was puzzled by Nathan's manner and
made no reply. The man turned quickly into
the house and soon returned with a well-filled
stocking in his hands. Tom instantly surmised
what the stocking contained, for he was
well aware of the banking purposes to which
that article of clothing was turned in many
of the homes.</p>

<p>"Come with me, Friend Thomas," said
Nathan, grasping a hoe as he spoke and leading
the way into his garden. There he dug
a hole, and, placing his "bank" within it,
covered it again with the earth.</p>

<p>"But Nathan," protested Tom, "if these
men search your place for money they'll find
this spot, and it'll show at once you've hidden
something there. The earth is all fresh
and moist here, and it's dry all around it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yea, thou speakest truly, Friend Thomas,
but I have a thought by which I may yet
outwit these men of war. Tarry here till I
return."</p>

<p>The Quaker instantly turned and again entered
the house. In a moment he appeared,
bearing a large bowl in each hand. One contained
water, which he poured over the place
where his money was concealed, and the other
was filled with corn. He quickly scattered
the corn over the wet ground, and then,
turning towards the barn, called, "Chick!
Chick! Chick! Come, chick! Come,
chick!"</p>

<p>Instantly there was a fluttering within the
barns, the doors to which were wide open,
and the hens came running from every direction.</p>

<p>Nathan's face took on a meaning smile as
he watched his flock hastening toward him
for their breakfast, and then, turning to Tom,
he said, "Is it plain to thee, Friend Thomas,
that it is still possible for a man of peace to
outwit these sons of Belial? Now go and
tell thy companions that such food as I have
shall be set before them."</p>

<p>Tom laughed at the trick of the Quaker,
and then ran back to his horse, and, mounting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
started towards his recent companions,
whom he could see still waiting in the road.
Doubtless they were becoming impatient by
this time, and, without waiting to go all the
way back to the road, he stopped at a distance
and called to them, beckoning with his
hand for them to come, as he shouted.</p>

<p>As soon as he perceived that the lieutenant
heard him, he turned about and once more
rode back to Nathan's house. He then dismounted
and tied his horse to a post which
stood near to the kitchen door.</p>

<p>As he glanced up he saw that the leader
was riding alone up the lane and now was
near the house. Just then he heard the
sound of a horse behind him, and, turning
quickly about, saw young Lieutenant Gordon
dash past him on horseback.</p>

<p>Amazed by the sudden and unexpected
appearance of his friend, he stood still and
watched him as he rode swiftly up the lane
directly toward the approaching men. Gordon
was leaning low on his horse's neck, and
Tom could see that he was grasping a pistol
in his right hand.</p>

<p>Before the startled lad could fairly realize
what was occurring, he saw the young lieutenant
raise his weapon and aim it at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
approaching horseman. He waited for the
report, but none came. Again Gordon raised
his pistol, and once more it flashed without a
report.</p>

<p>His heart almost stopped when he perceived
that the other members of the band had now
entered the lane and were riding towards
their leader, although as yet they were far
behind him. The young lieutenant had also
discovered them, and, instantly turning his
horse about, dashed back up the lane, with
the British lieutenant in swift pursuit.</p>

<p>Unmindful of Tom, they swept past him,
and Gordon turned the corner of the barn.
Twice around the barn the men raced their
horses, and then Gordon turned his horse into
the open doorway and dashed through to the
other side.</p>

<p>After him followed the leader of the British
band in desperate pursuit, and then, as Tom
glanced up, he saw his recent companions
come shouting and hallooing into the yard
which was between the barn and Friend
Nathan's little house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BOAT ON THE BAR</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Little Peter discovered the presence
of the men before him, his first impulse had
been to turn and make a dash into the woods;
but the call which he heard quickly changed
all that. As one after another of the band
appeared, he recognized some of them as men
who had been enrolled in the local militia,
and his alarm for a moment subsided.</p>

<p>The one who had addressed him he remembered
as a young man not much older than
himself, who had all the summer been away
from his home, busied with his friends and
neighbors in protecting the salt works along
the shore, and striving to hold back the outlaws
from their raids in the county.</p>

<p>The salt works were of especial value at
this time, as some of them were owned by the
government and aided in increasing the scanty
revenues of the poverty-stricken country.
Several of them already had been burned by
tories or bands of sailors, who had landed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
from some of the gunboats which had come
to anchor off the shore for the purpose of
inflicting such damage as lay within their
power upon the adjacent region.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Peter?" repeated
the lad who had first spoken.</p>

<p>As Little Peter now recognized the men
before him as friends, he quickly related to
them the story of the sad misfortunes which
had come upon his home; and the many expressions
of anger and sympathy which his
words called forth were not unwelcome, we
may be assured, to the troubled boy.</p>

<p>When his brief story was told, the young
man who had hailed him said, "We're on an
errand that may fit into your feelings a bit.
We're short one man, too. Don't you want
to join us?"</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do?"</p>

<p>"We've just had word that a boat is
aground off here on the bar, and we're going
to see if we can't get her. We've got a
whaleboat down here on the shore, and we're
going to put out in her and see if we can't
pull the other boat off and bring her in with
us."</p>

<p>"But there are a couple of gunboats not
more than three quarters of a mile out," protested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Peter. "You can't do anything while
they are there."</p>

<p>"We can try," said the man who was acting
as the leader. "We're one man short,
as Lyman here has just said, and if you feel
inclined to join us we shall be glad to have
you."</p>

<p>Little Peter hesitated. It was not alone
the danger of the enterprise which troubled
him. He was thinking of his father and his
own purpose to discover whether he had been
sent to New York or not.</p>

<p>When he explained the cause of his perplexity,
the leader said, "That's all right,
Peter. We're going down to Tom's River
just as soon as we've taken this boat out
here. You see, our watch told us the boat is
loaded with supplies, and, if we can get her,
we're going to do a double deed, for we'll
keep the others from having them, and we'll
make good use of the stuff ourselves. Now,
if you'll go along with us, you'll make another
oar for us, and we'll be all the more
likely to succeed. Then you can go with us
down to Tom's River, and poor company will
be better than none in times like these."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Little Peter quickly, and
the march was at once resumed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>As they approached the wigwam, where
Peter had left his Indian friends, he stopped
for a moment to explain to Indian John the
cause of the change in his plans.</p>

<p>John listened quietly until the lad had finished,
and then said, "Me see um again."</p>

<p>Little Peter did not understand just what
the Indian meant by his words, but he did
not wait to inquire, for his friends were already
in advance of him, and he hastened to
rejoin them.</p>

<p>No one spoke as they silently walked on
to the shore, but when they had gained the
bluff, Lyman suddenly said, "There! Look
there, will you? The word was all right.
The boat's aground out there on the bar."</p>

<p>Little Peter instantly recognized the boat
as the one which he had seen approaching
from the gunboats, and for which the band
of men from Refugee Town had evidently
been waiting. Doubtless they had mistaken
him and Indian John for members of the
neighboring militia, and the cause of their
pursuit was now explained.</p>

<p>The men did not hesitate now, but going
to a place a little farther up the shore, they
hastily removed a pile of brush and drew
forth the long whaleboat which they had concealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
beneath it. The boat was not heavy,
and, lifting it in their arms, they bore it
down to the water's edge.</p>

<p>Then grasping its sides, they ran with it
into the water, and, at the word from the
leader, scrambled on board. In a moment
they were all seated, the long oars were
drawn forth, and the men gave way with a
will.</p>

<p>Little Peter was in the bow, next to his
friend Lyman. The excitement now for a
time banished from his mind the thoughts
of his sorrow, and even the search for his
father was for the moment forgotten.</p>

<p>About three-quarters of a mile out at sea
were the two gunboats riding at anchor, and
resting as gracefully upon the water as if
they had been birds. Directly before them
was the supply boat, about a quarter of a mile
from the shore, and not more than that distance
in advance. They could see that four
men were on board, and they were still striving
desperately to push her off from the bar
on which she had grounded.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken on the whaleboat
now, and the men were all rowing with long
and steady strokes. The ocean was unusually
calm, but every lift of the heavy groundswell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
disclosed to them more clearly the outlines
of the boat they were seeking. Their
purpose had not yet been discovered by the
men on the other boat, or if it had been discovered
no token was displayed. It was more
than possible that they were regarded as
friends coming to the aid of the unlucky boat.</p>

<p>In this manner several minutes passed, the
whaleboat, meanwhile, making rapid progress
over the water, driven forward by the efforts
of the determined men. The long, sandy
shore stretched away in the distance, the
masses of clouds in the sky seemed to be
lined with silver as the rays of the sun shone
through them, and not a sound could be
heard except the heavy breathing of the men
and the regular clicks of the oars in the row-locks.</p>

<p>In spite of the peacefulness of the scene,
however, all the men in the whaleboat fully
realized the desperate nature of their undertaking,
and the likelihood that in a moment
everything might be changed. Still, there
were no evidences of action on the gunboats,
and the men on the grounded boat betrayed
no signs of alarm.</p>

<p>"There are some men on the shore up
yonder," said the leader, as he saw a group<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
standing on the beach directly opposite the
boat they were seeking. "They don't seem
to be able to help them," he added. "I don't
believe we've anything to fear from them.
Give way, men! Give way!"</p>

<p>The band responded with a will, and the
whaleboat darted forward with increasing
speed. The other boat lay only a few yards
away, and the end had almost come. The
excitement on board was intense now, and,
although no one spoke, the expression on
every face betrayed the feelings of the men.
They could see that the others were watching
them, but still they manifested no alarm at
the approach of the whaleboat.</p>

<p>As the latter ran in alongside, and the men
quickly backed water, one of the sailors on
the stranded boat&mdash;for such their uniforms
disclosed them to be&mdash;called out, "You're
just in time, men! We thought we'd never
get this tub off the bar. The tide's coming
in, but we're stuck fast."</p>

<p>"That's just what we came for," replied
the leader, as he threw a rope to the other
boat. "Now make fast and we'll yank you
off before you know it."</p>

<p>One of the sailors caught the rope and
made it fast, but evidently a change came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
over his feelings then, for, glancing suspiciously
at the men before him, the one who
had acted as the leader said, "You're from
Refugee Town, aren't you? You're strangers
to me, but I take it for granted you're
all right!"</p>

<p>"No, sir; we're militia from Old Monmouth.
We've come out here to get you
and your boat, too. Here, none of that!"
he quickly added, as he saw the men turn to
grasp their guns. "We'll send you to the
bottom before you can tell your names if you
try any of your games on us."</p>

<p>At his command the men in the whaleboat
quickly covered the others with their guns.
For a moment the silence was unbroken.
The advantage for the present was very decidedly
with the attacking party. Not only
did they outnumber the others, but they were
also in a condition to act, and act quickly.
The situation, however, could not long remain
as it was. The gunboats were not more
than a half mile away, and, doubtless, assistance
would be sent as soon as the predicament
of the men should be discovered.</p>

<p>Then, too, there were the men on the shore
to be reckoned with. Apparently, they had
no boat with which they could come to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
rescue of the luckless sailors, but they might
soon obtain one, for Refugee Town was not
far away. Why they had not already gone
there was not apparent. Perhaps they were
trusting to the aid of the rising tide and the
efforts of the men.</p>

<p>"Pass over your guns!" said the leader
on the whaleboat.</p>

<p>The men obeyed, and silently picked up
and handed their guns to the attacking party.</p>

<p>"Now we'll see what can be done," said
the leader, after he had deposited the weapons
on the bottom of the whaleboat. "These
fellows are harmless now, and we'll take our
oars and see if we can't pull them off from
the bar."</p>

<p>His men grasped their oars and began to
row. The rope tightened, the boat started a
little, but still stuck fast to the bottom. Again
the men pulled desperately, but with all their
efforts they could not move the grounded
boat.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we'll have to cast overboard
a part of the load," said the leader, when the
third effort proved as futile as its predecessors.</p>

<p>He arose from his seat and grasped the
rope to pull the whaleboat nearer, when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
four men before him suddenly united in a
loud shout, and, leaping from their seats,
together grasped some other guns which had
been concealed beneath the sailcloth, and,
turning about before their captors could recover
from their surprise, stood aiming their
weapons directly at their faces.</p>

<p>"It's our turn," laughed one of the men.
"You'll hand over your own guns now!"</p>

<p>No one in the whaleboat moved from his
position. The leader still stood, leaning over
the side and grasping the rope with his hands.
Every one had been so startled by the unexpected
summons that he seemed almost incapable
of action.</p>

<p>"Come, be quick about it!" said the sailor,
as the men still did not move.</p>

<p>A faint sound of a shout now could be
heard from the shore, and the movements of
the men there, as they ran about the beach,
betrayed the fact that they were aware that
something was wrong. In the distance, Little
Peter could see that two barges filled with
men were starting forth from the gunboats.
The situation was becoming rapidly worse,
critical as it then was.</p>

<p>"Their guns aren't loaded, men!" called
the leader suddenly. "They can't harm us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Still his men did not respond. For an instant
no one moved, while their fear was
plainly evident from the expressions upon
their faces. No one knew whether the leader's
words were true or not, and in breathless
suspense they waited, fearing every moment
to hear the reports of the guns in the other
boat.</p>

<p>As the men did not fire, the leader quickly
shouted again, "They're not loaded, I tell
you! They can't hurt us! Don't pay any
attention to them!"</p>

<p>His words instantly served to arouse his
companions, for they now knew that if the
guns had been loaded they would have been
discharged before this.</p>

<p>The sight of the barges which had started
forth from the gunboats, and the increasing
confusion of the men on the shore, combined
to render the attacking party desperate now.
Whatever they were to do they must do
quickly.</p>

<p>The leader called to his companions to
cover the others with their guns, and, drawing
the whaleboat close up, said: "The
boat's loaded with guns and powder! That's
just what we want. Now you take your oars
and push while my men row," he added,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
speaking to the sailors. "The first one of
you that draws back will get a dose of lead.
Now! Quick! Do as I tell you!"</p>

<p>The men sullenly laid down the empty
guns, and, picking up their oars, began to
push against the sandy bottom. The men
in the whaleboat were rowing desperately,
and soon could feel that the other boat had
started.</p>

<p>It was not yet free, however, and the leader
called again to the sailors, "Harder, men,
harder! You aren't half pushing. That's
right! Harder yet! Harder, I say! We'll
be out of this in a minute. Give way, men!
You aren't asleep, are you? Pull! Pull!"</p>

<p>In his eagerness, the leader laid down his
gun, and, hastily grasping an oar, began
to pull with his companions. Slowly the
grounded boat responded to their efforts.
Inch by inch it slipped from the bar, but was
not yet free.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the confusion on the shore was
increasing. The men were running up and
down the beach, waving their arms and shouting.
The two barges were coming swiftly
from the gunboats, and if the loaded boat
was not soon dragged from the bar, it would
once more be in the possession of the enemy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>They were still working desperately. The
perspiration stood out in great drops upon
their faces. They braced their feet against
the seats in front of them and put forth all
their strength. The moments seemed like
hours to the struggling men, but the loaded
boat was slow to respond to their efforts. It
was steadily yielding, however, and at last
they saw the boat slide from the bar and rest
easily upon the open water.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TED WILSON'S VICTIM</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A shout</span> arose from the eager crew as they
perceived the success which had crowned their
desperate efforts, but an answering shout from
the men in the two approaching barges
quickly recalled them to the necessity for
further and immediate action. Why it was
that the guns of the gunboats had remained
silent they could not understand, but there
was no time now for investigations. It was
sufficient that they had not been molested
thus far; and as the leader at once gave the
command for them to resume their labors
with their oars, the men at once responded
and gave way together, the supply boat still
being towed.</p>

<p>The whaleboat had been built for speed,
and was long, narrow, and light. Had it
not been for the laden supply boat, which as
yet they were not willing to abandon, they
would easily and speedily have drawn away
from the pursuing barges. As it was, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
swept forward swiftly, and apparently were
almost holding their own in the race.</p>

<p>For several minutes the desperate efforts of
the men continued. The heavy clouds had
gathered in the sky, and the blaze of the sun
had disappeared. The air was sultry and oppressive,
and the unusual calm which rested
over the waters indicated that the storm which
had been threatening was fast approaching.
No one glanced at the heavens, however, the
set and streaming faces indicating that the
immediate task in hand was sufficient of itself
to occupy all their thoughts.</p>

<p>On and on rowed the men, and on and
on swept the pursuing barges. Less than
a quarter of a mile lay between them, and,
heavily laden as the supply boat was, it
materially decreased the speed which otherwise
the whaleboat might have made. The
moments passed, but the efforts were not
relaxed. Together, the long oars struck the
water, and the bodies of the men swayed back
and forth as if they were controlled by a
common impulse. The distance between the
boats was not materially changed, although if
any change was to be seen it was in favor of
the barges.</p>

<p>"This will never do," said the leader at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
last, letting his oar go, and rising in his seat
as he spoke. "Here, you men," he added,
grasping his gun and facing the prisoners in
the other boat as he spoke, "it's time for
you to work your passage. Take those oars
and pull your prettiest! Four oars are better
than one, and I can do more with a gun than
I can by pulling. Take your oars, every one
of you, and the first one to drop will be fired
on!"</p>

<p>The four men in the supply boat sullenly
obeyed, and the increased impulse of their
efforts at once became manifest. The leader
stood in the stern of the whaleboat facing
the prisoners, and watchful of their every
movement. His words of encouragement
served to inspire his companions, and for a
time it appeared as if they were gaining upon
their pursuers.</p>

<p>Still, the distance between them did not
materially increase, and such efforts as the
men were then making could not be long
maintained. Indeed, signs of distress were
already becoming apparent, and Little Peter
felt every time he drew in his oar as if he
had not strength enough left to pull another
stroke. His face betrayed the pain he was
suffering, but his condition was not much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
worse than that of some of the other men
with him in the boat.</p>

<p>The exciting contest could not be continued
much longer, and as the leader glanced
about the boat he almost decided to cut the
rope which held the supply boat, and, leaving
that behind, seek safety in flight.</p>

<p>He had drawn his knife from his pocket,
and was standing ready to free them from
their heavy load, when the rain began to fall.
In a moment the wind swept down upon
them, and the storm was at hand.</p>

<p>Prom the first of the pursuing barges
came a shot, but no damage was done, and
the leader muttered, "That's all right. It's
a farewell salute you're giving us. You
might as well say good-by to us, for I take it
you'll never see us again."</p>

<p>The waves were now rising, and the rain
was falling in torrents. Between them and
the shore it almost seemed as if a cloud
intervened, so heavy was the downpour. The
voice of the leader could hardly be heard by
his men. The deep-toned thunder sounded
almost continuously, and the darting lightning
appeared to be all about them. In
escaping from one peril they had encountered
another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The barges could now no longer be seen,
and, with the passing of the fear of pursuit,
the men gave all their attention to their
efforts to keep the whaleboat out of the
trough of the rolling waves. Still, the supply
boat was not cut loose, for the determined
men were resolved to hold to that so long as
it lay within their power to do so.</p>

<p>For a half hour the shower continued, and
although much water was shipped, and the
men were compelled to bail the boats, they
behaved well. When at last the storm had
passed and the low mutterings of the thunder
sounded far out to sea, they all looked keenly
behind them to discover the whereabouts of
their pursuers.</p>

<p>Neither of the barges was to be seen.
Doubtless, with the approach of the shower,
they had both put back to the gunboats for
safety. The whaleboat had weathered the
storm, and the supply boat was still safely in
tow.</p>

<p>Drenched though the men were, new
strength seemed to come with the knowledge
that they were no longer being pursued, and
then, relieved of their fear, they continued
on their way down the shore.</p>

<p>They frequently stopped for rest and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
scan the waters behind them, but no boat
could anywhere be seen. Nor was any one
to be discerned upon the beach. Doubtless
the men from Refugee Town had fled for
safety and shelter, or, as the leader grimly
said, "They were afraid of being wet, for
water was something to which all the men
assembled there were strongly opposed."</p>

<p>For mile after mile they held steadily to
their course, even their excitement apparently
having mostly disappeared. The supply boat
contained guns and ammunition, and if there
was anything of which the militia stood in
need, it was of that very commodity.</p>

<p>At first it was thought that they would
put in at the entrance to Shark River, but it
was soon decided to continue on their way
until they should come to Manasquan Inlet,
and then go up the river to a place where
some of their friends were to be found. To
gain Tom's River they would be compelled to
keep on to Barnegat Inlet, and then retrace
their way up Barnegat Bay, to the place
where the river entered; and as that would
require a voyage of thirty miles more, no one
regretted the change in the plan.</p>

<p>They were all nearly worn out by their
exertions, and no one knew what British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
vessel might be met before they could gain
the shelter of Tom's River.</p>

<p>Little Peter, in spite of his eagerness to go
on to the place where he hoped to learn something
concerning his father, was so weary
from the work of the day, and as he had not
tasted food since early that morning, he rejoiced
with the others when at last the boats
turned into Manasquan Inlet and began to
make their way up the little stream.</p>

<p>The sun was now low in the western sky,
and the night would soon be upon them.
The shadows already were lengthening when
the two boats passed out of the inlet into
the waters of the river. The leader, however,
had not yet given the word to rest on their
oars, and Little Peter did not know where
they were to pass the night.</p>

<p>The whaleboat kept steadily on in its course,
and the wearied men were still pulling at the
oars. The river was becoming narrower now,
and more than one was hoping that the word
would soon be given for them to land.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the leader called to his men,
and, standing erect, pointed excitedly to a
place on the shore not far in advance of them.
His companions quickly looked in that direction
and saw on the little point of land, around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
which the river swept in its course, two men
standing in the water. But what was it they
were doing? One of them was holding the
other and frequently forcing his head beneath
the surface of the river. He would hold
him in that position for a moment and then
lift him upon his feet again, and shake him,
much as a dog might have done with a
rabbit. Apparently neither had observed the
approaching boats, nor had either uttered a
sound which the men in the whaleboat could
hear.</p>

<p>"The fellow's drowning him!" said the
leader excitedly. "He's drowning him. Give
way, men, and we'll lend a hand."</p>

<p>The men, no less excited than their leader,
instantly responded, and the boats dashed
rapidly forward. The eyes of all were fixed
upon the two men before them, and the leader
shouted and called; but apparently, unmindful
of their approach, the strange actions
continued. The larger of the two men again
and again forced the head of his companion
under the water, and then would lift him up
and repeat the shaking. So thoroughly intent
was he upon his strange occupation, that he
did not once heed the hail, or even glance
toward the whaleboat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearer and nearer swept the boats, and
finally, when they were almost upon him, the
man ceased his efforts and glanced coolly up
at the approaching men, still, however, retaining
his grasp on his victim, who apparently
was helpless in his hands.</p>

<p>A startled exclamation escaped Little Peter's
lips when he saw that the smaller of the men
was none other than his own neighbor, Benzeor
Osburn. "Help him! Help him!" he
said excitedly to the leader. "It's Benzeor!
It's Benzeor Osburn! He's my neighbor!
He's being drowned! He'll be killed!"</p>

<p>"Be still!" said the leader roughly. "It's
Ted Wilson that's got him. Ted knows what
he's doing. What's the trouble, Ted?
What's gone wrong?" he added quickly,
addressing the man who still held Benzeor
tightly in his grasp.</p>

<p>The huge man slowly turned his head as
he heard himself addressed, and Little Peter
thought he never before had seen such an
expression of rage upon any human countenance.
His great muscular arms were bare,
and his entire body seemed to express the
marvelous strength he possessed. Benzeor
was not struggling, and indeed there seemed
to be but little hope of protecting himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
from the powerful man whose prisoner he
was.</p>

<p>Little Peter could see that, although Benzeor
was almost breathless, he had recognized
him, but he made no effort to speak and
scarcely glanced at the men before him.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Ted?" repeated the
leader. "What's the matter with the man?"</p>

<p>"The matter isn't with the man, it's with
me," said Ted slowly, speaking in a deep,
gruff voice, which betrayed the strong feeling
under which he labored.</p>

<p>"You're not going to drown him, are
you?"</p>

<p>"Naw&mdash;though the snake deserves it.
Drownin' is too good for such as he!"</p>

<p>Ted had not moved from his position, and
still was standing up to his waist in the water.</p>

<p>"Tell us about it. Maybe we can help
you a bit."</p>

<p>"Naw, ye can't help any. It's my business.
I don't mind tellin' ye how it came
about, though. This forenoon I sold some
corn and stuff up here at the mill, and got
my pay in coin, too. Well, this fellow was
there and he saw me get paid off, and I half
suspected the reptile from the way he looked
at me when he saw me take the money. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
you!" he quickly added, as Benzeor struggled
slightly. "Ye want some more, do ye?
Well, I'll give ye all ye want and all ye need,
too," and again he thrust the helpless Benzeor's
head beneath the water.</p>

<p>"Let him up. You'll drown him!" said
the leader, when Ted had held his victim
several seconds under the water.</p>

<p>"It's no more than he deserves," replied
the huge man, nevertheless lifting his victim
and shaking him again. "Now will ye keep
still?"</p>

<p>As Benzeor was unable to reply, Ted again
turned to the men in the boat and said, "Well,
I took that money home and gave it to Sallie.
She's my wife, ye know, and I always gives
her what money I get, not that it's ever very
much, though. I didn't ferget the eyes o'
this fellow, however, and I told Sallie,&mdash;she's
my wife, ye know, and as likely a woman as
there is in Old Monmouth, if I do say it as
ought not to,&mdash;I told her to keep a good
lookout for the pine robbers, fer I had a kind
of a suspicion this here reptile might know
where they was, and might get word to 'em,
too.</p>

<p>"I took my axe and went off down into
my swamp-lot to cut some wood, and left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Sallie up in the house. Sallie's my wife, ye
know. I felt uneasy like all the time, but
I worked on for three hours or more, but
I kept a-gettin' uneasier and uneasier, and,
finally, I just couldn't stand it any longer
and put straight fer the house.</p>

<p>"'Twas mighty lucky I did, too, I'm
tellin' you, fer when I came in sight o' the
house,&mdash;ye can see it up there now," and
Ted pointed to his home, a short distance up
the bank, giving the unfortunate Benzeor an
additional shake as he did so,&mdash;"I see somethin'
was wrong. There was three or four
men a-standin' out by the big maple in front
o' my house, and the minit I looked I see
what they was up to. Somebody was a
hangin' from a bedcord they'd threw over a
limb o' that very maple-tree.</p>

<p>"Mebbe ye know how I felt when I see it
was my Sallie; she's my wife, ye know.
They was a-drawin' her up and then lettin'
her down, and I knew then they was tryin'
to make her own up where that money was.
I had my axe in my hands, and when I see
what they was up to, I didn't wait very long,
I'm tellin' ye. I cut Sallie loose,&mdash;she
wasn't very much hurt; she's my wife, ye
know,&mdash;and then I took after the rascals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
They scattered in every direction, but this
vermin started for the river and I after him."</p>

<p>"You got him, I see."</p>

<p>"Did I get him? Let him answer for
hisself."</p>

<p>And the angry Ted again shook the helpless
Benzeor until the men wondered that his
trembling limbs still held together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A FRUITLESS CHASE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> surprise of Tom Coward was not diminished
as the novel race continued. Twice
through the open doors of the barn dashed
the two riders, their horses' hoofs slipping on
the rough floor and almost throwing the men
from their seats. Both continued to maintain
their positions, however, and would no
sooner disappear from Tom's sight than they
would be seen coming around the corner of
the barn again, the young American lieutenant
still in advance and the British officer in
close pursuit.</p>

<p>Friend Nathan was standing in the doorway
of his house, and, in spite of his peaceful
professions, there was an eager expression
upon his face which betrayed the fact that
he was not an uninterested observer of the
strange contest. Tom had not moved from
his position, and his excitement had almost
deprived him of the power of speech.</p>

<p>Again through the open doorways of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
barn the riders had urged their swiftly running
horses, but as yet their relative positions
had remained unchanged. The British officer
was leaning forward on his horse's neck
and endeavoring to grasp the bridle of the
young lieutenant's horse, but the quick movements
of the latter had prevented him, and
the mad race continued.</p>

<p>As Lieutenant Gordon dashed around the
corner of the barn, and for the fourth time
prepared to enter the open door, Tom saw
that the other members of the band were just
entering the yard. The excited lad could
not longer remain silent. His friend was
beset by new perils and must be warned.</p>

<p>"Look out! Look out!" shouted Tom.</p>

<p>Young Gordon looked up and for the first
time beheld the increase in the number of his
enemies. Without hesitating a moment, he
turned his horse toward the low fence and
cleared it at a bound. Then, directly across
the open lot toward the woods in the distance
he urged his trusty steed, and almost before
the men in the yard perceived what had
occurred, he had placed a considerable distance
between him and the barn.</p>

<p>The confusion, however, lasted but a moment,
for, with a shout, several of the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
urged their horses forward, and, leaping the
low fence, renewed the pursuit. Those who
did not follow raised their guns and discharged
them at the fleeing officer; but
either his movements were too swift, or their
excitement prevented them from taking careful
aim, for the bullets went wide of their
mark, and in a very brief time the young
lieutenant disappeared within the woods, and
soon after his pursuers followed him.</p>

<p>"Thee didn't seem to catch him," said
Nathan blandly to the men who remained in
the yard.</p>

<p>"They'll get him. They'll get him,"
replied the leader. "They'll soon run him
down, never you fear. But he's a bold fellow,
there's no mistake about that. What
did you call out to him for?" he added,
turning sharply to Tom.</p>

<p>"Did I call out to him?" replied Tom.
"I don't just know what I did, I was so
excited. I thought you had him."</p>

<p>"So I would, if it hadn't been for the
barn floor."</p>

<p>Tom thought the barn floor was perhaps
as much of a disadvantage to the pursued as
to the pursuer, but he discreetly held his
peace and said no more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, old man, you can get us some
breakfast. My men will be back here in no
time with the young rebel, and will have all
the better appetite because of their morning's
work. You can feed us all, can't you?"
said the officer.</p>

<p>"I have spoken to Rachel. Doubtless she
will do her best for thee."</p>

<p>The men at once proceeded to place their
horses in the barn and serve them freely
from the Quaker's store. Then they entered
the house and seated themselves at the table
which Rachel had spread for them, although
they first stationed one of their companions
as guard.</p>

<p>For a time no one spoke, so busied were
they in their occupation, and Tom Coward
was not one whit behind any of them. He
was tired and hungry, and the breakfast
was doubly welcome to him. Rachel moved
quietly about the room, her drab dress and
broad white collar being in marked contrast
to the brilliant uniforms of her self-invited
guests.</p>

<p>"Old man," said the officer at last, "I
wish you'd tell me how it happened that that
young rebel was here on your place. You
weren't sheltering him, were you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay," replied Nathan. "In times like
these, Friends are not prone to shelter any
soldiers. Our guests are only those who
come without any bidding of ours."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the officer. "I fancy
you mean that as a reproach for us. Well,
we'll pay you for our breakfast, never you
fear about that. Your scruples don't carry
you so far that you object to receiving a
return in good yellow or white metal, do
they?"</p>

<p>"The laborer is ever worthy of his hire.
I shall be thankful for any equivalent it may
seem good unto thee to bestow upon me."</p>

<p>"That's right, that's right. Trust a
broad brim for that every time. I'm not
complaining, old man, I'm not complaining.
You don't happen to know just where the
rebel army is at present, do you?"</p>

<p>"It is reported that Washington is on the
march for this very place. Even now he
may be approaching."</p>

<p>"Do you know that?" inquired the officer
in a lower tone.</p>

<p>"Nay. I know nothing of their movements.
It is all of the current report I am
speaking to thee. I fear me that a man of
peace is likely to suffer double ills between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the two armies, for it is also reported that
the British and their Hessian companions are
also likely to march through this very region."</p>

<p>If the officer had glanced at the old
Quaker he would have discovered that there
was a very keen expression upon his face as
he ventured the last supposition. But as he
did not look up it was all lost upon him, and
perhaps if he had seen it, he would not have
understood its meaning, since his host was
ostensibly a man of peace.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," said the officer
quietly. "We've come to look over the
land and report to Colonel Simcoe. What
makes you think the rebels are near here,
and are likely to march this way?"</p>

<p>"I will tell thee truly. The young man
whom your companions are pursuing slept
last night in my barn. He informed me
frankly that Washington was to pass this
way"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And fall on our army?" broke in the
officer eagerly.</p>

<p>"That is the natural inference for thee to
draw. It's a sad day for the Friends. They
are ground between the upper and the nether
millstones, for I understood thee to say that
the British also were to come hither."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can understand what you please,"
replied the leader gruffly. "You've given
me the information I most desire and Colonel
Simcoe would be glad to reward you for it,
but being, as you are, a man of peace, of
course you wouldn't be willing to take anything
from a man whose occupation is blood
letting. Hello! here's the guard!" he added,
rising abruptly from the table as he spoke.
"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the guard, "except
that our men are returning from the woods."</p>

<p>"And did they catch the young rebel?"</p>

<p>"No, or at least he's not with them now."</p>

<p>All hurriedly left the table and rushed out
into the yard, Tom also going with them.
The men could be seen returning across the
lot, but it was at once evident that the young
lieutenant was not with them.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble? How was it that
you let the slippery little rebel get away from
you?" demanded the leader, as the soldiers
once more entered the yard.</p>

<p>"Simply because he could ride faster than
we could," replied one of the band in a surly
tone. "His horse was fresh and ours had
been out all night."</p>

<p>The officer was angry, but, after a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
sharp words to his men, he bade them enter
the kitchen and get their breakfast.</p>

<p>"Did thee find him?" inquired Nathan.</p>

<p>"No, we didn't find him. I'd chase him
right into camp if it wasn't that I must
hurry back to the colonel with the word
you've given me. You're sure about what
you told me?"</p>

<p>"What did I tell thee?" inquired Nathan
blandly.</p>

<p>"About the march of the rebels," replied
the officer angrily. "I half believe you're
in league with them yourself, in spite of all
your whining words. If I thought you were
I'd leave your body for the crows to pick."</p>

<p>"And is that the method which seemeth to
thee to prove thou art right, and that I am no
man of peace?"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind, old man, never mind my
words. Perhaps I'm a little too hard with
you. This young rebel's getting away from
us has put me out of temper. What I want
to know is whether you believe what you
said about the rebels coming through Cranberry."</p>

<p>"I have given thee the words as they were
given me. I am not in the councils of the
'rebels,' as it seemeth good to thee to call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
them, and cannot say more. It is for thee to
judge, not me, who am a man of peace and
not familiar with the ways of warlike men."</p>

<p>By this time the men had finished their
breakfast, and a hurried consultation followed.
The decision at which they arrived was soon
apparent when the leader approached Nathan,
and, holding forth some silver in his hand,
said, "There, take that for the breakfast
you've given us."</p>

<p>"I thank thee," replied Nathan, accepting
the money.</p>

<p>"Are you going back with us, lad?" said
the officer, turning to Tom as he spoke.</p>

<p>"No. You said all you wanted of me
was to point out the way to Cranberry."</p>

<p>"So I did, but if this old man speaks the
truth,&mdash;and I'm inclined to think he does,&mdash;you'll
be better off with us than you will be
to stay behind when the rebels are coming.
You'll have a good horse to ride, too; you
must not forget that."</p>

<p>"I think I'll stay. I'm not afraid of the
rebels, and can find my way all right." Tom's
heart was beating rapidly, and the fear that
permission for him to remain would not be
granted was uppermost in his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Have it your own way, lad, have it your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
own way. I only spoke what I thought was
for your own best good."</p>

<p>He gave a few orders to his men, and in a
brief time the band departed, riding swiftly
up the road and soon disappearing from
sight.</p>

<p>"This was not a bad morning's work,
Friend Thomas," said Nathan, when at last
the men were gone, jingling the silver in his
pocket as he spoke.</p>

<p>"It was a good deal better than I ever
expected to have," replied Tom.</p>

<p>Neither of them realized, however, the full
consequences, for Nathan's words, in addition
to what the officer had already discovered,
caused him to return in all haste with
the information he had received to Colonel
Simcoe. That officer, upon receiving the
word, which was corroborated by other discoveries
he had made, at once reported to
Sir Henry Clinton, and an immediate change
in the plans of the British was made. The
advance to the Raritan was speedily abandoned,
the route to the Highlands was at
once chosen, and it was decided that the
army should march by the way of Monmouth
Court House. The battle of Monmouth,
which soon followed, thus became possible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and that, with all its consequences to the
struggling patriots, turned upon the information
which Colonel Simcoe had received, and
which he speedily carried to his commander.</p>

<p>Upon such slight events do those which we
sometimes call the greater ones turn. Perhaps
as we grow older and wiser we shall
come to perceive more clearly the true relation
which the so-called little things of life bear
to the greater ones. A very wise man once
declared that "he who was faithful in the
little affairs of life was very greatly faithful."
In any event, we have partially learned the
lesson that it is a test of true greatness to be
able to do little things well, and that the
very best evidence of a man's being able to
do the greater things is that he is willing to
do the smaller ones, as they come to him,
faithfully and honestly.</p>

<p>However, neither Nathan nor Tom was
moralizing after this fashion when they entered
the house after watching the departure
of the British soldiers. Tom then related all
his recent experiences to Nathan, not omitting
the story of Benzeor's misdeeds.</p>

<p>The old Quaker listened attentively, and it
was apparent from his frequent expressions of
anger that his interest in the success of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Continentals was not entirely banished by his
peaceful professions.</p>

<p>"What thee needs now, friend Thomas,"
he said, when at last the lad's story was
ended, "is a good rest. Rachel has a bed
ready for thee."</p>

<p>Tom followed his friend to the room upstairs,
and soon stretched himself upon the
bed. How grateful it seemed to the weary
lad! For a moment he gazed at the four
high posts, but soon everything was forgotten
and he was asleep.</p>

<p>How long he slept he did not know, but he
was awakened by Nathan, who called to him
and said, "Friend Thomas, there is some one
below who desires to see thee."</p>

<p>Tom leaped from the bed and followed the
Quaker down the stairs, wondering who it
was that wished to see him. There were
confused thoughts in his mind of the British
officer and Benzeor, but he was not in the
least prepared for the sight upon which he
looked when he entered the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A RARE BEAST</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is necessary now for us to turn and follow
some of the movements of that army
which Tom Coward was so eager to join.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Clinton fully understood that
he had little to gain from an engagement
with Washington's army at this time. The
Americans were not holding any position
which he desired to gain, their stores and
equipments were of slight value, and if
Washington should be defeated, the result
would be that his men would simply be scattered
in the surrounding region, where they
would still be free to carry on their straggling
methods of warfare, and harass the British
by falling upon their baggage trains and
shooting at the men as they marched along
the country roads.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Clinton's stores were
numerous and of no little value. The loss of
them would be a serious blow to the redcoats,
while the possession of them by the Continentals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
would put new life into the cause
of the poorly equipped patriots. And above
all of these things, the danger which now
threatened from the approach of a French
fleet led the British commander to hasten
forward to the defense of New York, which
he feared was likely to be the first place to
be attacked by the allies of the colonies.</p>

<p>The very motives which caused Sir Henry
to wish to avoid an engagement were those
which appealed most strongly to Washington
to enter into one. He had but little to lose
and much to gain. A defeat for the British
would mean a weakening of the defense of
New York, and the long train of baggage
wagons was a most tempting prize. The possession
of those stores would replenish the
scanty supplies of the Americans; and, as we
know, Washington had eagerly pushed his
army forward, hoping to gain a position in
advance of the British and fall upon them in
some advantageous position which he himself
could select.</p>

<p>The main body had advanced as far as
Hopewell, as we have already learned in the
course of this story, but there had halted for
a brief time. The weather had been unusually
trying, and as a consequence the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
were suffering intensely. Even the "oldest
inhabitants" had never known such a summer.
The thermometer had climbed well up
into the nineties and then had stayed there.
The frequent thunder showers apparently did
not cool the air and afforded no relief, as the
sultriness seemed to be increased by each
one. The roads had become heavy and well-nigh
impassable in places, and when at last
the men had marched to the plains of Hopewell,
Washington wisely halted to give them
their much needed rest.</p>

<p>Another matter led the great commander
to remain there for a time. He had now
gained a position which offered him a considerable
advantage, and he wished to call a
council of his officers to consult concerning
his further movements.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the second of the councils
since the army had departed from Philadelphia
was then called, and the one question
in the mind of the commander was this:
"Will it be advisable to hazard a general
engagement?"</p>

<p>General Charles Lee, who was second in
command, and was by some even then suspected
of being in secret league with Howe,
was present, and his voice was soon heard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Lee was a Welshman, brilliant in certain
ways, and had seen much service in the
armies of Europe. Many had preferred him
to Washington as the commander-in-chief of
the American armies, and Lee himself was
not averse to the idea. He affected to regard
Washington with contempt, looking upon
him as a man who lacked military training
and of but little ability. His jealousy
already had been the cause of many serious
troubles, and at the present time, in spite of
the fact that he had been exchanged for the
British general Prescott, captured in a manner
not unlike that in which Lee himself had
been taken in a previous winter at Morristown,
he apparently was unmindful of all the
regard bestowed upon him, and was not unwilling
to see Washington make some mistakes
which would bring upon the leader the anger
of his fellows, and perhaps open the way for
Lee to gain his position. This view of the
case is certainly to be preferred to that which
marked him simply as a traitor and in league
with the enemy, although in all likelihood
both, in a measure, were correct. Probably
Washington understood the man thoroughly
at the time, and we may be certain that his
troubles were not decreased by his knowledge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Lee was possessed of a strikingly ugly
face, and his plain features were the cause of
many rude jests among the soldiers who were
opposed to him. But whatever his lacks in
personal beauty or moral character may have
been, he at least had a most persuasive tongue.
His eager and impulsive manner, his commonly
accredited ability, and his foreign
training, which had great influence among
many of his ruder and unpolished companions,
caused some of the men about him
to become ready listeners to what he had to
say.</p>

<p>In the council which Washington called at
Hopewell, Lee exerted himself to the utmost
to oppose the proposition to enter into an
engagement with the advancing British. So
persuasive were his words that the majority
of the officers voted with him that it would
not be advisable to detach more than fifteen
hundred men from the main body to harass
the enemy on their flank and rear, while the
remainder of the army should preserve their
present position relative to the British, and
be governed by circumstances.</p>

<p>Just what Lee's motive was is not fully
apparent. Whether he wished to avoid a
battle or simply desired to cause Washington<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to fail in taking advantage of the favorable
opportunity, which Lee himself must have
seen had presented itself, is not clearly known.
It may have been a combination of both
wishes.</p>

<p>General Wayne bitterly opposed the proposition
of Lee, and generals such as Greene,
Lafayette, Steuben, and others, expressed
themselves as being decidedly of the opinion
that, at the very least, twenty-five hundred
men should be detached from the main body
and sent forward to carry out Washington's
plan.</p>

<p>Lee's motion, however, prevailed; but while
Washington seemingly consented to the decision
of the council, we can now see, as we
look backward, that his own purpose was not
changed. Perhaps he was strengthened in
his opinion by the words of General Wayne
and General Greene, spoken after the breaking
up of the assembly, for we know that
they then expressed themselves very freely to
their leader.</p>

<p>Apparently yielding to the expressed wishes
of the majority, Washington dispatched General
Scott with fifteen hundred men "to
gall the enemy's left flank and rear," as he
expressed it in the letters he wrote that day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to General Dickinson and the president of
the Continental Congress; and on the following
day advanced with his army to Kingston,
and halted there on the very day when
Tom Coward arrived at the house of Friend
Nathan Brown in Cranberry.</p>

<p>As Tom came down the stairs and entered
the room below, his surprise was great when
he saw young Lieutenant Gordon standing
before him. "Where&mdash;where did you come
from?" said the astonished boy. "I thought
they chased you out into the woods!"</p>

<p>"So they did. So they did," laughed the
young officer; "but that doesn't mean that
I was bound to stay there, does it? I had
spent the night with Friend Nathan here, and
I had such a good time I almost decided to
come back for another. And then, too, I
left a lad here whose face haunted me, he
looked so scared and white."</p>

<p>"I was scared," said Tom, "for I thought
they'd got you. How in the world did you
ever manage to get away from them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've learned by experience," replied
the lieutenant, laughing. "This was about
the closest call I ever had, and once there,
when my horse slipped on the barn floor, I
thought I was done for; but it's all come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
out right, you see. When I once got into the
woods I knew I was all right, and I didn't
have to go very far, either. About noon I
thought I'd venture back and see what had
become of Friend Nathan and Tom Coward,
for I didn't believe those redcoats would stay
here very long after they found out that our
army is over here by Kingston."</p>

<p>"Kingston?" said Tom quickly. "Kingston?
Why, that's only ten miles from
here!"</p>

<p>"Correct, my son; correct. They'll be
nearer yet, very soon."</p>

<p>Tom was excited in a moment, and eagerly
began to ask many questions. The young
lieutenant replied to them all, and then said
to the Quaker, who had remained silent during
the conversation, "And now, Friend
Nathan, you feel sure that those redcoats will
carry the word back to Clinton that we've
turned out of our way to meet them, do you?"</p>

<p>"Verily, I do," replied Nathan. "It was
for the very purpose of learning the plans of
Washington that they dared to venture as
far as this. I endeavored to learn from the
soldier what effect he thought his report
would have upon the British leader, but he
did not speak in many words. Doubtless he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
considered them valueless to a man of peace.
But thy surmise is correct, I doubt not."</p>

<p>"Then the sooner we put out of this the
better, Tom; that is, if you're still of the
same mind you were day before yesterday."</p>

<p>"I'm ready to go," replied Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>The thought of the American army being
only ten miles away aroused all his enthusiasm
once more. He knew nothing of camp life,
and the hardships were not in his thoughts.
He knew that he had no place to which he
could go, and now that he had left Benzeor's
home he felt like an outcast. Besides, he
had dreamed of joining the army, and, now
that at last the longed-for day had arrived,
all his curiosity and eagerness returned in full
measure.</p>

<p>"But I haven't any horse and you're
mounted," he added. "I don't see how I
can go with you. You can't wait for me to
trudge along on foot."</p>

<p>"That is something of a poser," replied the
lieutenant. "No, it's a fact I can't waste
much time on the road with such news as I
have to carry back to camp. Perhaps my
horse will carry double part of the way."</p>

<p>"I have a beast I might let thee have,"
said Nathan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the way to talk!" said the lieutenant
eagerly. "Where is this horse of
yours?"</p>

<p>"It is out in the back lot in the woods.
My heart was filled with fears of the war
men, and I dared not to leave any of my
property within their sight."</p>

<p>As Nathan still hesitated, the lieutenant
said quickly, "Hurry up, Nathan! Get your
horse and let us start. We've no time to
lose."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest that I am a man of peace,"
said the Quaker slowly. "It is not for me to
waste my property in this wicked war."</p>

<p>"That's the way the wind blows, is it?"
laughed the lieutenant. "Well, I don't know
that I can promise you very much, but I'll
do what I can for you after I get back to
camp. But I'll tell you what, Nathan, you'll
not be the loser to give up the horse to us,
and with a good grace, too. Both of the
armies are likely to pass this way, and you
won't have much left on your place, I can
tell you. Now, if you give it up you may
get something for it, and then, too, you'll
have the credit of doing something for your
country."</p>

<p>"What did the war men give thee, Friend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Thomas? Did I not hear thee say that the
war men rewarded thee for thy services?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom quickly, drawing the two
half joes forth from his pocket as he spoke.
"Here they are. You can have them and
welcome."</p>

<p>"The beast is not what would be considered
a valuable one, Friend Thomas, and
yet he is still capable of rendering some service
to me. I will take one of thy half joes
and leave the other with thee. Then thou
canst see that I am suitably repaid after thou
hast joined thy comrades in the war."</p>

<p>The young lieutenant slyly winked at Tom
as the lad handed the man one of his half
joes, and then said, "Hurry up, Nathan!
We've got to start soon, and ought to be off
now. We'll do the best we can for you, as
we said. You're going to give us something
to eat, aren't you, before we go?"</p>

<p>"It shall be according to thy desire.
Rachel, if thou hast some milk and a small
portion of corn bread, set it before these
guests whilst I am gone for my beast."</p>

<p>The old man departed, and his wife carried
out his request. The lieutenant and Tom at
once seated themselves at the table and hastily
ate the food she set before them, for neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
knew when another opportunity might be
found. In the ten miles which lay between
them and the army of Washington many adventures
might be awaiting them, and it was
only the part of wisdom to make the most of
the present.</p>

<p>"I have thy beast for thee," said Nathan,
soon afterwards entering the room. "He is
not what might be called by thee a swift
beast, but he is still possessed of some excellent
qualities. Thou hast promised to see
that I am further rewarded for my gift."</p>

<p>Tom and the lieutenant hastened out of
the room to examine Nathan's "gift," and, as
they saw the horse which he had tied to the
post, they both stopped in surprise and the
lieutenant broke into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, Friend Nathan," said he, adopting
the Quaker's style of speech, "thou art a
friend indeed! Dost thou call that thing a
'beast'? Thou hast cheated the lad woefully.
A good half joe for that scarecrow?
Thou oughtest to reward Thomas for riding
him, for I am of the opinion that I shall be
compelled to carry him into camp in two
pieces if he mounts that 'razorback.' Oh,
Nathan, Nathan! Who would have believed
it of thee?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The horse was old and gaunt. A spavin
was apparent in one leg, while on another
was a great ringbone. One eye betrayed its
blindness, and, altogether, the poor animal
presented a most woe-begone and helpless
appearance.</p>

<p>"He hath not beauty, as I told thee," said
Nathan soberly. "But he is of value to me,
and thou hast promised to see that I am suitably
rewarded."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom! Tom!" laughed the lieutenant.
"What a sight you'll be on the back
of that bunch of bones! There's no help
for it, though. Come on and we'll see what
the poor 'beast' can do!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RELEASE OF BENZEOR</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Benzeor's</span> plight was a sad one, but as he
gazed about him in his helplessness the only
face upon which he could discover any traces
of sympathy or compassion was that of Little
Peter. The lad had had no suspicion of his
neighbor, and was ignorant, as we know, of
the part which Benzeor had taken in the
attack on his father's house. Even now it
was difficult for him to believe that Ted had
spoken truly. He must have been mistaken,
Peter thought, as he recalled the kindness of
Sarah and Benzeor's wife in permitting the
children to find a shelter in their home.</p>

<p>Perhaps the perplexed lad's face betrayed
his feelings, for just at that moment Benzeor
looked up and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There! That boy knows me!" and he
pointed at Little Peter as he spoke. "He
knows all about me, for he's a neighbor of
mine. I tell you there's been a mistake.
I'm not the man you're"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Benzeor's words were suddenly interrupted
by Ted, who thrust his head again under the
water, and when he lifted him out once more
the prisoner was sputtering and gasping for
breath.</p>

<p>"Made a mistake, did I?" exclaimed the
angry giant. "Well, mebbe I did, but I
reckon the biggest one was in not keepin'
you under the river all the time. Runnin'
round here prowlin' on defenseless women
folks and tryin' to steal what little money
they've got left! Drownin' 's too good for
such as you!" And, unable to restrain himself,
the angry man again shook his helpless
victim till it seemed as if the little breath Benzeor
retained must be driven from his body.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm telling you the truth,"
gasped Benzeor when he had recovered sufficiently
to be able to speak again. "Won't
you help me? Won't you save me from this&mdash;this&mdash;man?"
he pleaded, turning to the
men in the whaleboat. "That&mdash;that boy
there knows me, and he'll tell you I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm
all right. Won't you, Little Peter?
Please! Please, tell them!"</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" said the leader to
Little Peter.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the lad quietly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye don't know any good of him, do ye?"
said Ted, interrupting, and tightening his
grasp upon the collar of his victim as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"He is a neighbor of mine, as he said. I
never knew any bad of him. And his wife
and girl are taking care of the children. I
know that." Little Peter was perplexed, and
his suspicions had been aroused by the discovery
of his neighbor in his present predicament,
but the recollection of Sarah's kindness
moved him to refer to their recent actions, in
the hope that he might aid her father.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho!" laughed Ted. "Then
his wife takes care of her children, does she?
She must be a wonderful woman to do that.
Well, let her take care of her brats, and I'll
take care of her man, and good care, too!"</p>

<p>As Ted acted as if he were about to renew
his attentions, the leader hastily said, "The
lad doesn't mean this fellow's children, but
his own little brothers and sisters," and in a
few words he related the story of the attack
on Little Peter's home, and the sad loss
which had occurred there.</p>

<p>"Ye don't say so!" said Ted, bestowing a
glance of sympathy upon the boy. "That's
bad! It is indeed! And ye say this fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
has taken yer little brothers and sisters into
his place?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is that I'd about as
soon put a hawk to look after chickens, if it
was my doin's."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Benzeor quickly, striving to
take advantage of the impression which Little
Peter's words had momentarily created.
"Yes, the children are all at my house, and
being well looked after, too. That doesn't
look very much, does it, as if I was a bad
man? I tell you there's been a mistake!
There's been a mistake! I didn't have
anything to do with the attack on this man's
place. Help me! Help me!" he hastily cried
out, as Ted acted as if he were about to repeat
his former actions.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, Ted. Perhaps the
man's got something more to say," said the
leader.</p>

<p>"I am a-holdin' on. Can't ye see that?"
replied Ted grimly, once more tightening his
grasp upon the unfortunate Benzeor's collar.</p>

<p>"I have got something to say. Something
you want to hear, too," said Benzeor eagerly,
and appealing to the leader in the whaleboat
as he spoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say it," said Ted gruffly.</p>

<p>"The British are going to make an attack
on the ship down in the bay."</p>

<p>"What's that you say?" said the leader
quickly. "Do you mean on the Washington?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that's just what I mean. There
are a couple of gunboats off the shore here
now, and they're going to land some men
and get her back again."</p>

<p>"There are two boats off the shore, Ted.
I happen to know that, for this very craft
we've got along with us we took from them
this afternoon," said the leader. And he
briefly related the story of the capture.</p>

<p>"There, ye see I'm right!" said Benzeor,
eager to follow up the impression his words
and those of the leader had created. "Now
if you'll help me out of the clutches of"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Keep still, you!" interrupted Ted angrily.
"It'll be time enough for you to
talk when I let go on ye. I reckon nobody
is a-goin' to take you out o' my clutches till
I get good and ready to let ye go. Now
then, stand up straight and speak yer piece
like a little man! How did ye happen to
know the British was a-goin' to make an
attack on the Washington?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard one of the men up by your house
say so."</p>

<p>"I thought ye didn't have anything to do
with that attack on poor Sallie! She's my
wife, I'd have ye know. I thought you was
a-sayin' you wasn't there, and all the time I
see ye, and chased ye right out o' my yard,
clear down to the river! And now ye say
ye heard one of the men there tell about the
plan the British have on deck to get the
Washington back again!"</p>

<p>"I didn't say I wasn't there," pleaded
Benzeor. "All I said was that I didn't
have anything to do with it, and I didn't."</p>

<p>"Ye"&mdash;began Ted, all his anger instantly
returning.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Ted! Hold on! Let's hear
what the man has to say," exclaimed the
leader.</p>

<p>"I'll hold on, never ye fret yerself about
that!" replied Ted, still retaining a firm
grasp on his victim, but nevertheless abandoning
the action he had evidently had in mind.</p>

<p>"I was there, I'm not denying that,"
pleaded Benzeor; "but I didn't have a gun
in my hands, and I didn't touch the rope
either. I fell in with the men and they
made me go with them. I just couldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
help myself. And it was while I was there
I heard 'em talking about the plan to take
the Love&mdash;I mean the Washington," he
hastily added. "They're going to take her
in the morning."</p>

<p>"You mean they're going to try to take
her," said the leader.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I mean; they're going
to try to take her."</p>

<p>"The reptile may be tellin' the truth,"
said Ted soberly. "I had some o' the best
o' the Washington's cargo myself. Ye know
they brought about all that was aboard o' her
up to Manasquan, and sold it here, or leastwise
Marshal John Stokes sold it for 'em. I
happen to know about that, and the vermin
here may be tellin' the truth. Sometimes he
does it by mistake, I suppose."</p>

<p>A few weeks prior to this time the British
ship Love and Unity ran ashore near Tom's
River. There were those among the people
of the region who wagged their heads and
winked slyly whenever they referred to the
misfortune of the vessel, for it was a prevailing
impression there that the pilot had not
been especially favorable to the British, and
more by design than by accident had grounded
the vessel near the shore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Be that as it may, the militia had quickly
rallied, and as most of the men were as much
at home upon the water as they were upon
the land, they seized the unfortunate Love
and Unity, and brought her safely into port
as a prize.</p>

<p>The cargo was considered a very valuable
one, consisting, as it did, chiefly of sugar and
various liquors highly prized by the men of
those days, and, after being duly advertised,
was sold by John Stokes at Manasquan.</p>

<p>The Love and Unity was renamed the
Washington, and at this time was lying at
anchor near the mouth of Tom's River,
within the shelter of Barnegat Bay. As
most of the men in the whaleboat, as well as
the mighty Ted himself, were familiar with
these facts, the words of Benzeor naturally
created a far deeper impression than they
might otherwise have done.</p>

<p>"I'll tell ye what," said Ted suddenly,
turning Benzeor about so that he could look
directly into his face as he spoke, "ye seem
so well posted I've half a mind to let ye go."</p>

<p>"I'm telling you just exactly what I
heard," said Benzeor, his hope of escape
instantly increasing. "That's what I heard
the men say."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"And it was in the mornin' when they
was goin' to come?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm a-goin' to let you off. Hold
on a minit," he added as Benzeor strove to
free himself. "I haven't finished yet. I'm
thinkin' of lettin' ye go on one condition."</p>

<p>"What's that?" said Benzeor eagerly.</p>

<p>"I'm comin' to that pretty quick. I'm
pretty comfortable here, so to speak, and
don't appear to be in such a hurry as
you." As the two men were still standing
in the water, and Benzeor's teeth were chattering
from cold or fear, the words of the
huge man were perhaps not fully appreciated
by his prisoner. "Ye appear to be so happy
over yer information&mdash;though fer my part I
don't see what ye held it back till this time
fer&mdash;that I'm a-goin' to give ye a treat. I'm
a-goin' to let ye go, yes, I am; ye needn't be
scart about that. Ye're goin', and I'll tell ye
where ye're goin', too. Ye're goin, to join
the crew o' this whaleboat and go down and
help them defend the Washington against
her enemies. That's the condition I'm
placin' on ye, and that's what I'm goin' to
do with ye."</p>

<p>And the powerful man picked Benzeor up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
in his arms and placed him in the whaleboat
next to Peter, who, we may be sure, had not
been an uninterested observer of all that had
occurred.</p>

<p>"There ye be," said Ted, breaking forth
into a loud laugh as he saw the dripping
Benzeor hastily take his seat and glance
apprehensively toward him. "Now, then,"
he added, turning to the leader, and still
remaining in the water, which came well up
to his shoulders as he placed his hand on
the side of the supply boat, "if ye want me
to, I'll take charge o' yer prize. You'll be
puttin' straight fer Tom's River, I doubt
not, and ye won't want to be bothered by an
extra craft. I'll hide her in a good place up
the shore, and likely enough I may come
down to the bay myself in the night. Ye'll
be settin' up a-waitin' fer me, won't ye?"
he added, speaking to Benzeor.</p>

<p>As that individual made no reply, Ted
again began to converse with the leader of
the band, and in a few minutes all the details
were arranged. The captured boat was to
be left in his charge, and soon the whaleboat
started down the river toward the ocean.</p>

<p>The sun had now disappeared from sight,
but the approach of night was all the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
favorable for the plans of the men. When
once they were out on the ocean, they hoisted
a sail and sped rapidly down the coast.</p>

<p>A sail of a little more than twenty miles
brought them to Barnegat Inlet, and as they
entered the bay it was decided to make use
of the oars again. It was almost midnight
when at last they saw the Washington at
anchor in Tom's River, and their hail was
quickly answered.</p>

<p>Little Peter was so thoroughly wearied by
the labors of the long day that he was rejoiced
to be told that he could turn in for
the night. Benzeor was to have a hammock
near him, and, tired as the lad was, he eagerly
began to ply the man with questions when
they had withdrawn from their fellows.</p>

<p>"Benzeor, I came down here to find out
about father. I suppose you know he was
taken by Fenton's gang and that my mother
was shot?"</p>

<p>"I heard about it."</p>

<p>"It was terrible, Benzeor. I don't know
what I should have done if Sarah hadn't
taken the children. 'Twas good of her, and
of you, too, for you know all about it, I see.
I shan't forget it very soon."</p>

<p>As Benzeor made no reply, Peter continued:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
"I don't know just what to do to find
out about father. The pine robbers have
their quarters down here, I'm told, and I
thought I'd tell Captain Dennis about it and
perhaps he would send out a party to search
for him. I didn't know just what to make of
your being here at first, but I see you have
had trouble with them, too. That was mean
of Ted to treat you as he did when you said
the pine robbers made you go with them.
Was it Fenton's band that got hold of
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that is, I don't think so. I'm not
just sure who they were."</p>

<p>"Couldn't have been Fenton then, for
you know him when you see him, I'm sure.
Benzeor, don't you think I'd better report
the capture of my father to Captain Dennis
and ask him if he won't send out a searching
party?"</p>

<p>"No," said Benzeor slowly. "I don't
think that will do any good."</p>

<p>"Why not? What else can I do?"</p>

<p>"Why, the fact is," said Benzeor, "I
heard those men talking about your father,
too."</p>

<p>"Did you?" said Peter eagerly, sitting up
in his hammock as he spoke. He could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
see his companion's face in the darkness, and
perhaps it was as well for the troubled lad
that he could not, for he would have seen
little to comfort him expressed upon it.</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard 'em. There's no use in
your reporting it to Captain Dennis or to
any one else."</p>

<p>"Why not? Why not? They haven't
shot him, have they?"</p>

<p>"No. He's been sent to New York."</p>

<p>Peter said no more. The thick darkness
seemed like that within his own soul. All
his efforts had been worse than useless, and
the troubled boy knew not what next to do.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FLEET OF BARGES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present visit was by no means the
first which Little Peter had made to Barnegat
Bay and the vicinity of Tom's River. Before
the outbreaking of the war he had occasionally
gone there with Webberly West, the
most noted hunter of deer and wolves in all
the region. Great had been the pride of
Little Peter when he had returned home with
his first deer, some four or five years before
this time; and, as he lay in his hammock
that night, again and again his thoughts
wandered from his present difficulties to the
days when he had tramped through the
region with the venerable hunter Webberly.</p>

<p>The old man had died just before the war
began, but many of his quaint expressions
and kindly acts remained in Little Peter's
memory. He it was who had taught him how
to dig the pits and cover them over with
brush, and place the tempting pieces of meat
as a decoy for the prowling wolves. Little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Peter could never forget the first time success
had crowned his efforts, and he had looked
down upon the eyes of the wolf which had
fallen into the pit. He could feel the thrill
of that excitement even now.</p>

<p>And <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Webberley'">Webberly</ins> had taught him also how
to catch the great snapping turtles which
abounded in the streams. Sometimes turtles
were taken which weighed fully thirty pounds
each. What savage creatures they were! and
yet the old hunter had handled them as if
he had known no fear. A constant war was
waged upon these creatures by the settlers
for two reasons, one of which was that they
were highly valued as an article of food.
The captive would be thrown into a barrel
and for a few days fed upon the refuse from
the tables, to which perhaps at times more
substantial food would be added, and then
when the turtles had gained the proper degree
of plumpness, a feast would be made to
which friends and neighbors were not infrequently
invited. The eggs of the turtles
also were highly valued; and so plentiful
were they in the warm sand along the shore
that a bushel-basket was frequently filled with
them after a brief search. It was true the
foxes were as eager as the men to dig out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and devour the turtles' eggs, but the supply
appeared to be almost inexhaustible and there
were more than enough for all.</p>

<p>Another reason which prompted the settlers
to prey upon the huge turtles was the fact
that their ducks suffered from the savage
creatures. A turtle would seize a duck in
his claws and tear and devour the bird in an
incredibly short time. Naturally, the owners
of the ducks objected to the methods of the
turtles, and a constant warfare was the result.</p>

<p>Peter had occasionally gone down to
Barnegat with Indian John also. The Indian
always seemed to know just where the
clams could be found in greatest abundance,
and he knew as well just how they ought to
be cooked. He would dig a hole in the sand
and then fill it with wood, to which he would
set fire. Then the clams would be poured
into the place and covered over with seaweed
and brush. When a sufficient time had
passed, the brush and seaweed would be
raked out, and the cooked clams were considered
as a great luxury. This custom of the
Indians was bequeathed to the whites, and
their method of cooking the clams remains
in some portions of the land until this day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the thoughts of his own troubles
and his recollections of former visits to the
place in which he then was, not much sleep
came to Little Peter that night. The knowledge
that his father had been sent to New
York&mdash;for the troubled lad did not think of
doubting Benzeor's words&mdash;and the prospect
of an attack upon the Washington on the
following morning were both sources of deep
anxiety to the sadly troubled boy. Only four
men were on board when the whaleboat had
returned; and while the addition of the ten
men she brought, or eleven if Benzeor was
to be included in the list of the Washington's
defenders, materially increased her strength,
still, the prospect of a strong defense was
not very bright, and if the truth was known
Little Peter was not the only one on board
who passed a sleepless night.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, the lad was sorely
troubled as to his own future movements.
With his father a prisoner in New York and
the children quartered for the present at Benzeor's,
Little Peter could not determine what
was best for him to do. To go to the city
and seek to aid his father there would be
worse than useless now; nor was he able to
provide for his younger brothers and sisters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
The problem had not been solved when at
last he fell into a troubled sleep, from which
he was awakened by the sound of men moving
about on deck.</p>

<p>Hastily arising, and noting that Benzeor
already was astir, he soon made his way up
to his companions. The sun was well up in
the eastern sky, and the men were preparing
for such a defense as might be made against
any attempt to retake the boat.</p>

<p>Little Peter found that the most of the
men did not believe that any such attempt
would be made; and the suspicion with which
they regarded Benzeor increased the feeling
of sympathy which the lad felt for him, for
to him it seemed as if his neighbor had been
most unjustly treated, not only by the powerful
Ted, but by the men of the whaleboat as
well. He thought he had abundant cause for
believing in Benzeor's honesty, for had he
not received his own little brothers and sisters
into his home? Surely, a man who would do
that could not be bad, and his indignation
against his recent companions increased as
he noticed their ill-concealed dislike for his
neighbor.</p>

<p>The men all had breakfast on board; and
while a constant watch was maintained, nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
as yet had been seen to arouse their
suspicion that an attack was likely to be
made. Even Little Peter was beginning to
think that either Benzeor had been mistaken
or that the British had changed their plans,
and that nothing would be done that morning.
He was about to approach the leader
and explain to him the necessity for his own
departure, when he was startled by a cry
from the watch.</p>

<p>Looking out over the bay, Little Peter
could see a number of barges approaching.
Startled by the sight, he counted the boats
until he could distinctly make out eight of
them. Doubtless there were eight or ten
men in each boat, and altogether there must
be at least seventy in the approaching party.</p>

<p>The excitement on board the Washington
at once became intense. The men stood together
on the deck watching the little fleet on
the bay. The only means by which they
could defend themselves were their muskets,
and it was soon discovered that these would
not avail much against the enemy, for with
the aid of a glass it was discovered that in
the bow of one of the approaching boats a
small cannon had been mounted.</p>

<p>A hurried consultation was held by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
men on board, to which neither Little Peter
nor Benzeor was invited; the former because
he was considered too young to be of much
account, and the latter because no one trusted
him.</p>

<p>"They'll get this craft now," said Benzeor,
approaching the place where the lad was
standing. "Perhaps these fellows will believe
me another time."</p>

<p>There was a tone of exultation in Benzeor's
voice that startled Little Peter, and turning
quickly about he said, "You did speak truly,
Benzeor. I wish I were out of this. We
stand no chance at all."</p>

<p>"You needn't be alarmed. There won't
be any fighting done. You took my part
yesterday, and I'll not see you suffer now.
I'll fix you out all right."</p>

<p>"You'll fix me out? I don't see what
you can do. We ought to leave the ship this
minute. I don't see what we're waiting
for." Little Peter spoke anxiously and was
at no pains to conceal the alarm he felt.</p>

<p>"I hope they won't run," said Benzeor
quietly. His air of confidence was confusing;
but as yet Little Peter was not suspicious of
his neighbor.</p>

<p>"They don't act as if they were going to,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
said the lad quickly, as the assembly of the
men broke up and all began to rush about
the deck.</p>

<p>"Come, my lad! come!" said the leader.
"Lend a hand here! And you, too," he
added to Benzeor; "bestir yourself."</p>

<p>Benzeor's face fell, but he was in no position
to refuse to obey. Such defenses as the
Washington possessed were rolled together
behind the rail, and it was at once evident
that the men were not planning to give up
the ship without a struggle.</p>

<p>The long whaleboat was placed in readiness
to receive them, in case flight became necessary,
and then the men waited for the approach
of the attacking party.</p>

<p>The boats came steadily on, keeping well
together. Little Peter found himself sharing
in the excitement, but as the outlines of the
men became more distinct his fears increased.
What could be done against so many, for
it was now seen that there were more men in
the barges than at first had been estimated.
The boats were spread out in a semicircle,
but they were all converging toward the
Washington, and plainly would begin the
attack together. There were more of those
small cannon also than at first had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
seen; and as the boats came nearer and
nearer, it was discovered that a man was
standing near each and ready to fire at
the word of command.</p>

<p>The faces of the men on board the Washington
were all pale now, and not a word
had been spoken for several minutes. Each
man was intent upon the movements of the
men in the barges, and did not turn away
from the sight before him. Benzeor was the
sole exception, and Little Peter could not
understand the meaning of the half exultant
smile upon his face. For himself, he was too
badly frightened to speak, and the evident
fear manifested by his companions did not
tend to allay his own.</p>

<p>The waters in the mouth of the river
spread out almost as smooth as glass. The
rays of the morning sun were reflected from
the surface of the water and made it sparkle
like silver. The occasional call of some seabird
or the flight of the low flying gulls
were all that broke in upon the silence, but
no one heeded them. It was that slow moving
but steadily approaching fleet of barges
that held the attention of all.</p>

<p>Little Peter wondered why the command
to shoot was not given, for the boats were all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
within range now. His own hands were
trembling in his excitement, but he was eager
to act. At one moment he longed to leap
overboard and try to swim to the shore, and
then again he would feel as if he must do
something to check the approach of those
men in the barges.</p>

<p>Not a word had yet been spoken, however.
The oars of the approaching men could now
be distinctly seen as they rose and fell together.
Steadily on and on came the little
fleet, and now could not be more than two
hundred yards away. Why did not the men
on board do something? He felt that the
time for action had come, but all were standing
silent and motionless, apparently fascinated
by the sight before them. The smile
on Benzeor's face was almost mocking, and
Little Peter saw him look from the fleet to
the men on board, almost as if he were exulting
in their predicament. What could it all
mean? Why was not something done? Surely
the time for action had come, but still no
one spoke.</p>

<p>A hail now came from the approaching fleet,
and the man who evidently was in command
stood up in his place. He was still too far
away for his words to be heard, and again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the barges, which had halted for a moment,
resumed their approach and with an increased
speed.</p>

<p>"Men," suddenly called the leader of those
on board the Washington, in a low voice,
"we must get out of this! We're outnumbered
seven or eight to one, and it would
be just murder for us to stay here. Man
the whaleboat, and we'll put out for the
shore."</p>

<p>The hopelessness of any defense was so
apparent that the men instantly responded
and made a rush for the whaleboat, which
had been made ready for just such an emergency.
In a moment the men were on board
and had grasped their oars preparatory to
starting for the shore, when Little Peter suddenly
noticed that Benzeor was not with them.</p>

<p>"Hold on! Hold on a minute!" he called.
"Benzeor isn't here!"</p>

<p>The leader, who had remained on deck to
be the last to leave, turned quickly at the
words and discovered Benzeor striving to
conceal himself among the defenses which
had been piled together against the rail.</p>

<p>"Here, you!" he shouted. "Come out of
that and get aboard! Be quick about it!
I'll wing you if you don't," he added, raising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
his gun as he spoke, noticing that his
call was not likely to be heeded.</p>

<p>Benzeor quickly responded, and sullenly
took his place on board the whaleboat; but
the men were all too intent upon their escape
to bestow much attention upon him.</p>

<p>In a moment the leader leaped on board
and gave the order to give way. The long
whaleboat darted swiftly forward as the men
began to pull desperately at their oars. They
needed no encouragement now, for, with their
departure from the Washington, their only
hope of safety lay in a quick passage to the
shore, which lay about a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>A shout from the men in the barges
greeted the appearance of the whaleboat as
it shot out into sight, but the hail was not
heeded. One of the small cannon was discharged,
and from one of the barges came a
volley; but only one man was hit, and the
whaleboat rapidly increased its speed.</p>

<p>The shore was near now, and the desperate
men were putting forth all their strength.
The barges did not pursue, for the sailors
were intent upon gaining the ship first of all.
In a few moments the whaleboat grounded,
and the men leaped out and started quickly
for the woods which grew close to the shore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Peter was in the rear, and as he
turned back to see what would be done by
the other party, he was astonished to see
Benzeor turn quickly and start at full speed
for the whaleboat again. In a moment he
had leaped on board, and, seizing one of the
oars, with a strong push sent the boat far
out upon the river.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RIDE WITH THE LIEUTENANT</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Tom Coward</span> followed young Lieutenant
Gordon as he led the way to the post to
which Friend Nathan had tied the steed, and
then stopped and for a moment gazed ruefully
at the beast. His friend's good-natured
laugh broke forth again as he beheld Tom's
evident hesitancy about mounting to the back
of the animal; and surely to a boy who had
been accustomed to ride the colts in Benzeor's
pastures without saddle or bridle, and dash
about the lots in sheer delight at the antics
and efforts of the unbroken steeds to dislodge
their rider, there was not much to inspire or
impress him in the sight of the broken-winded
beast which Nathan had provided. Even the
horse himself appeared to be conscious of his
degradation, and stood motionless and with
hanging head, as if he, too, would protest
against any warlike efforts on his part.</p>

<p>"I've only one request to make, Nathan,"
said the lieutenant. "I'm sure you will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
object to it, but I think I'd better make it
before we start."</p>

<p>"What is thy request?" said the Quaker.</p>

<p>"If General Washington once sees that
horse, he'll want it for himself. You'll not
object, will you, to his use of it?"</p>

<p>"Nay. I think not that George Washington
will care for this beast of mine," protested
Nathan soberly, and apparently not
suspecting that the young officer was poking
fun at him. "Still, he may be able to make
him of some use. Thee will not forget to
see that I am suitably rewarded?"</p>

<p>"Never fear as to that, though I doubt not
my friend Tom here will be of the opinion
that you ought to pay him handsomely for
the pain he will suffer after he has ridden
your beast a few miles. That is, if the horse
can go as far as that."</p>

<p>"Thy heart may rest easy as to that. He
may limp when he first starts, but as soon as
his joints are warmed he will do thy service."</p>

<p>"We'll warm his joints, then," laughed
the lieutenant. "You might be warming
him up now, Tom," he added, turning to his
companion, "while I'm getting my horse
ready. He's in the barn, and I'll join you
in a minute or two."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>In a brief time the officer returned, but
his steed was showing the evidences of his
recent hard work, and Nathan's eyes twinkled
with satisfaction at the sight, for his own
horse, perhaps, might not then be at such a
disadvantage, and the prospect of a "suitable"
reward became more promising.</p>

<p>The young men quickly mounted, and,
after thanking their host in a substantial
manner for his hospitality, started down the
long lane which led to the road beyond.
Tom's horse limped painfully and caused no
little delight to young Gordon, who again
and again laughed aloud and offered all manner
of suggestions to the lad concerning the
impression he would create when the army
should discover his approach.</p>

<p>At times Tom thought of dismounting
and, turning the horse loose in the road, strive
to make his own way on foot; but the creaking
joints of the poor beast seemed to find
relief with action, and the young riders had
not gone far on their way before, to the surprise
of both, Nathan's steed was proving his
ability to keep up with the lieutenant's horse,
which evidently had been overridden and
was in no condition for a hard ride.</p>

<p>But, with the discovery of the service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
which Tom's horse might render, all the
disposition to regard their journey lightly departed
from the riders, and the serious nature
of their undertaking rendered both of them
silent. The American army could not be far
distant now, but between them and it all the
dangers had not disappeared. The visit of the
British band at the home of Nathan Brown
had indicated that other parties might be in
the region on similar errands; but Tom was
not thinking of these possibilities so much as
was the young officer who was riding by his
side.</p>

<p>Tom's meditations were mostly concerning
the American army. For months his strongest
desire had been to join it, and now that
the time had come when his desires were
likely to be satisfied, he discovered that much
of his eagerness was gone. Not that he had
any thought of turning back, but the proximity
of the two armies clearly indicated that
a meeting between the forces was not improbable,
and Tom's thoughts were largely of that.
The glamour was all gone now, and the serious
nature of his undertaking was uppermost
in his mind. The silence also of his companion
did not tend to allay his fears, but the
lad did not refer to them, and was doing his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
utmost to make his horse keep up the pace at
which he was going.</p>

<p>"Whew! This is a warm morning! Let's
give our horses a drink and a rest," said the
lieutenant at last, as he turned into a little
brook that crossed the road.</p>

<p>Tom followed his example, and the dripping
horses thrust their heads deep into the water.
The sun had now appeared and the beams
fell full on their faces. The air was motionless,
and even at that early hour was in places
quivering under the heat of the summer sun.
The very birds were silent, while high overhead
the heavens were like brass. On the
horizon masses of dark clouds were piled, and
a low, deep rumble startled both the young
riders.</p>

<p>"Was that a cannon, or was it thunder?"
inquired Tom quickly.</p>

<p>"Thunder. We may hear the cannon before
long, though."</p>

<p>"Why don't we start on, then? The
sooner we gain the army the better. We
don't want to be caught in here between
them." Tom spoke anxiously, and his fear
was as apparent in the expression upon his
face as in his words.</p>

<p>"We've got to give our horses a bit of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
rest. Mine has been going hard all night,
and yours won't be able to go far in such
heat as this. We'll have to be careful of
their strength, or we shall be worse off than
we are now."</p>

<p>"Have you been out all night? What
have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"Finding out what Clinton is up to. When
I was talking with Nathan I knew all the
time more about it than he did."</p>

<p>"Did you find out?" said Tom eagerly.
"What are the redcoats doing now?"</p>

<p>"Pretty much the same thing they've been
doing right along. They're making a change
in the direction they're going, unless I'm
greatly mistaken. And then, too, they've
done something else which doesn't promise
very well."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"They've drawn all their stronger forces
into the rear guard and sent on the Hessians
with the baggage train in front, for one thing."</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose they have done
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they've an idea, I fancy, that we're
going to try to take their supplies. They'll
find out, though, that we're after men more
than we are after their baggage wagons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
However, that explains the change in the
direction of their march, if I'm not greatly
mistaken. They've put the Hessians in front
and the best men behind."</p>

<p>"I wish they had left the Dutch butchers
there!" said Tom impulsively. "I hate the
Hessians. I hate the very name and sight
of them! Think of it! A lot of men just
hired to come over here and shoot and kill
and steal! I wish they had been left where
they were, that is, if General Washington is
ready for them!"</p>

<p>"I think you'll find him ready when the
time comes," remarked the lieutenant quietly.
"But about the Hessians. I don't like them
any better than you do, but somehow I can't
bring myself to feel about it as some of the
men do. I can't see that they're to be
blamed for being brought over here, or even
being engaged in such work as they're doing;
and I know more about that than you do,
too. The ones who are the worst are not
those who have come over here, but those who
have sent them. Just think of a petty little
prince, or king, being able to hire out a lot of
his own subjects to pay off his own debts
with! These men feel just the same as you
or I would, I have thought. They have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
wives and mothers and children, and yet they
have to leave them all and come over here
and be marks for our bullets, whether they
want to be or not. They just haven't anything
to say about it. They're told to come
and come they must, though there won't be
so many to go back as came over, I'm thinking.
At least, I'm going to do all I can to
thin out their ranks, though I feel sorry for
the poor fellows all of the time."</p>

<p>This was a new way of looking at the hated
"Dutch butchers," at least it was entirely
new to Tom Coward. He had heard only
the expressions of rage among the colonists
which their coming had aroused, and their
strange words and brutal acts had never
received much mercy in the judgment which
he had heard passed upon them by his acquaintances.</p>

<p>The anger of the patriots, perhaps, was but
natural; but the employment of the Hessians
has not furnished the only instance in history
where the first and most apparent view has
not always been the most correct one. Indeed,
it frequently happens that the troubles
between men, to say nothing of boys, arises
from a misunderstanding; and it is the part of
wisdom, as well as of justice, to look below<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the surface and try to discover the true conditions.</p>

<p>"Then the British are to be blamed, if
what you say is true," said Tom, after a brief
silence. "They are the ones at the bottom
of it all."</p>

<p>"Yes, the British are the ones who are
most to be blamed. But even there, Tom, if
I'm correctly informed, it's the leaders and
not the people. The way I understand it is
that the rank and file of the common people
in England are opposed to this war, and
would put a stop to it in a moment if they
could."</p>

<p>"If they could?" repeated Tom. "I don't
understand what you mean."</p>

<p>"Just what I say. The very best people
in England have, from the very beginning of
this war, been opposed to the taxes, the use
of the Indians, and the hiring of these Hessians.
It's the king and Lord North and
a few others of the pig-headed fellows who
are doing it all. Tom, my father and my
mother both came from England. As far
back as I can remember they have told me
stories of our old home and of the friends
we have over there. Why, do you know
it's been the dream of my life to go over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
there some day, and meet some of my cousins
and see the place where my father and mother
were born."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were a tory," said
Tom slowly.</p>

<p>"Tory? I haven't a drop of tory blood
in my veins, and hope I never shall have."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;you talk like one."</p>

<p>"Is it tory talk for me to say I don't blame
the Hessians for coming over here, but those
who hired them and sent them? Is it tory
talk for me to say I love to think of the place
where my father and mother were born, and
that I should be glad to look into the faces
of those who bear the same name I do, and
who have some of the same kind of blood in
their veins? Is it tory talk for me to say
that I'm proud of what Old England has
done, or rather of many things she has done,
from the days of William the Conqueror until
now? And that belongs to me as much as
it does to them, for my own grandfather was
one of the bravest men in the whole British
army! This war is like one between brothers,
and it's all the more wicked on that
account. And it's worse yet, because the
most of the Englishmen are not in favor of
it at all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't just see why you don't fight with
the redcoats, instead of against them, then."</p>

<p>"Because this is my home and this is my
country, and because the king and his court
aren't fit to govern cannibals, to say nothing
of men. No, sir, it's just because I do believe
in all I've said that I'm fighting for
my country and shall till the war is ended&mdash;which
I hope will be soon!"</p>

<p>"And would you shoot a redcoat or a
Dutch butcher?"</p>

<p>"Every time! It was a sad thing that the
war had to come, but as come it did, it would
be sadder still not to do everything in our
power now to carry it through. I'm sorry
for the Hessians, but I'd shoot every one of
them if I could do it. I'm sorry for the
redcoats, and I know they are not to be
blamed, or at least some of them are not,
but I'd mow them down now, every one of
them, as I'd cut the grass in haying-time.
Fight? Why, my lad, I'm in this war from
the crown of my head to the sole of my
foot! And I wouldn't stop till the redcoats
cry 'enough,' or we drive them right into
the Atlantic ocean, the way Parson Tennent
used to tell about the pigs in Gadara being
chased by the devils right into the sea. Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
that I think the ones who are doing the
chasing are in any way connected with the
swine drivers in the parson's story," he added,
laughing lightly as he spoke. "But we must
be going. Our horses are rested now, and
we'll be running into a thunder-storm before
we see the Continentals, if we don't look
out."</p>

<p>The ride was quickly resumed, but Tom
Coward was silent and sadly puzzled to account
for his friend's words. Apparently, he
was enthusiastic in his devotion to the cause
of the patriots, but he had never heard any
one talk in that manner before. His friends
and neighbors were all hard and bitter, and
the bitterness seemed to increase as the war
continued. But here was his friend, fighting
with all the devotion of his heart, and yet
not blaming the very men he was trying hard
to conquer for the part they were taking in
the war.</p>

<p>It seemed to him all strange, and while he
was deeply impressed by many of the words
of the enthusiastic young lieutenant, his own
feelings were of a very decidedly different
character. For a half hour they rode forward
as swiftly as their steeds could carry
them, but the heavy clouds had meanwhile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
been climbing higher in the heavens, and the
mutterings of the thunder had now become
deeper and heavier.</p>

<p>"We'll put into that barn ahead there,
and wait for the storm to pass," said the
lieutenant, pointing as he spoke to a rude
barn by the roadside.</p>

<p>As the rain was now falling, Tom was glad
to follow the advice, and in a few moments
they approached the open door. They had
not dismounted when a strangely clad being
stepped forth from the barn and shouted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Halt, will yez? I'll be after havin' yez
give an account of yerselves, that I will."</p>

<p>Tom glanced up in fear and surprise, and
the sight before him did not tend to allay his
alarm. The soldier presented a gun, but was
its bearer a man or woman? A long petticoat
certainly looked like the garb of a
woman, but the soldier also was clad in an
artilleryman's coat, while a cocked hat and
feathers crowned the head of the strange
being.</p>

<p>Tall, broad-shouldered, and with a voice
that was gruff and deep, the strangely clad
soldier bore but slight resemblance to a woman,
though the dress certainly seemed to
proclaim the sex of the speaker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>The rain was now falling in torrents and
Tom was drenched in a moment; but in the
brief silence which followed the demand of the
soldier, he could not determine what course
his companion would decide to follow.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A SOLDIER WOMAN</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Why</span>, Molly, you aren't going to keep
us out here in the rain, are you?"</p>

<p>Tom looked up in surprise as he heard the
young lieutenant's words; and while his fears
were somewhat relieved by the assurance that
his companion evidently had recognized the
peculiar being before them, his confusion
was not diminished by the reply which the
strangely clad woman quickly made.</p>

<p>"Sure, and it's me bye! It's me beautiful
bye! Come in, me darlint! What
for should ye be standin' out there in the
storm?"</p>

<p>The two dripping young soldiers speedily
accepted the invitation, and entered the barn,
leading their horses with them. To their
surprise they now discovered that several men
were also in the building, and that other
horses were stalled in the barn.</p>

<p>The appearance of Tom's horse was greeted
by a shout of delight, and the person whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Lieutenant Gordon had addressed as "Molly"
approached, and, after critically examining
the poor beast for a moment, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And where in the world did ye be after
findin' that? It's a pity, it is indade, to be
after compellin' such poor bastes as that to be
fightin' the Dootch butchers! Sure, and it's
the surgeon the poor thing is after needin'."</p>

<p>Molly's hair was of a bright red color, her
face was covered with freckles, which were
like great blotches upon the skin, and her
eyes were so faded as to be almost colorless;
but her expression was so evidently one of
good nature that Tom was compelled to join
in the laugh which her words raised among
the half dozen men who quickly assembled to
pass judgment upon the steed which had been
led into the barn.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's something we bought back
here to carry my friend as far as the army."</p>

<p>"It's lucky, it is, that ye haven't very far
to go, thin," laughed Molly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right, Molly," replied
the lieutenant. "How far back is the army
now?"</p>

<p>"About a mile, I'm thinkin'."</p>

<p>"What? What's that you say? Only a
mile from here?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what I'm tellin' yez. The army's
been marchin' in the night; but this rain will
be after compellin' it to halt right in&mdash;in
Gooseberry, as I'm told they call it."</p>

<p>"Cranberry," laughed the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Cranberry or Gooseberry is all one and
the same thing to me. Now, me bye, ye'll
be after wantin' some breakfast, I'm thinkin'.
Jest say the word and I'll be fixin' ye out,
and have a bit left over for yer poor baste,
which doesn't look as if he'd been livin' any
too high of late."</p>

<p>"No, no, Molly," protested the lieutenant
quickly, and, as Tom thought, with an eagerness
he could not understand. "We're not
hungry, for we had some breakfast before we
started this morning. We did indeed," he
added, as he noted the woman's apparent
unbelief. "We're not hungry, but it's kind
of you to think of us, and we thank you
just the same as if you had fed us."</p>

<p>In the course of the conversation between
the young lieutenant and the men in the
barn, Tom learned that the main body of the
army was now less than a mile away. The
little band had been one of the advance
parties, and the storm had compelled them to
seek the shelter of the barn by the roadside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rain continued to fall, and
long after the thunder ceased the storm
showed no signs of abating. The water
almost covered the road and penetrated the
roof of the barn, which was far from being
in a good state of repair. The heavy downpour,
however, did not seem to cool the air,
and the men and horses were in a sad plight.
Just why they should have sought the shelter,
which virtually was no shelter at all, Tom
could not understand; but he asked no questions,
and busied himself in listening to the
conversation of the men, and watching the
intrepid Molly, who to all appearances was
not aware of the fact that she was not as
much of a true soldier as any of the men.</p>

<p>After a half hour had passed the lieutenant
approached the boy, who was standing before
the open door, looking out upon the storm.</p>

<p>"Who is she? What is she?" inquired
Tom, indicating by a glance of his eyes the
strange woman whom his friend had addressed
as "Molly."</p>

<p>"She? Oh, she's the wife of one of the
cannoneers. She's been in the army for a
long time. She's from New Jersey, too, I
understand, though her husband's home is in
Pennsylvania."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't know there were women in the
army."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, there have always been some.
Why, even on that expedition of Arnold's
to Quebec there were several women who
marched all the way with their husbands, and
they say they stood the long tramps and the
cold better than a good many of the men did."</p>

<p>"Why did you call this woman 'Molly'?
Is that her name?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in the army, or at least in this army,
the women have been the ones to bring us
water on the warm days, and so we call each
one Molly 'Pitcher.' They've been kept
busy during this hot spell, too. This woman's
name I believe is really Molly, though,&mdash;Molly
McCauley. Then you didn't expect to
see women with their husbands in the army?"
laughed the lieutenant, as he noticed that Tom
was regarding Mistress McCauley curiously.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. I don't think I like it."</p>

<p>"You'll find all sorts and kinds of people
in the ranks. Some of the women have been
worth more than the men. There was one up
at Fort Clinton. She was very much such a
looking woman as Captain Molly here, only
she was a good deal more careless. They
used to call her 'Dirty Kate,' because she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
wasn't always very neat in her personal appearance.
But she was brave as a lion, and
such a fighter! Why, she fired the last
cannon at the British, as they came scrambling
over the ramparts, which happened to
be about the same time our men were leaving.
Well, Kate's husband was a cannoneer, just
as Molly's here is, and he was holding the
match in his hand ready to fire the gun when
he saw the redcoats coming, and the sight
suddenly reminded him that he had some
work to do outside the fort which demanded
his immediate attention. Well, Kate just
picked up the match her husband had dropped,
touched off the cannon, and then scampered
away after the men. She was a brave woman,
and so is Captain Molly, here. She'd do as
well as Kate did, if she had the chance, and
perhaps she will before the end comes. I
shouldn't want to have her fight me, I can
tell you!"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Tom turned and looked again at the woman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
She stood talking with her husband now, and
her strange garb served to intensify her
peculiarities. Her great size and evident
strength were plainly to be seen, but her face
beamed with good nature, and her enjoyment
of the life she was living was indicated by
her every word and action.</p>

<p>Tom thought of Sarah, and the contrast
between her gentleness and the rough appearance
and masculine manners of Captain Molly
aroused within him a feeling which was not
altogether in favor of the soldier woman. It
is true that the name of Sarah is unknown
to-day, while that of Captain Molly Pitcher
is recorded in all our school histories; but,
after all, notoriety may not be the most valuable
quality in life, and while the names of
many men and women who lived quiet, faithful,
honest lives may have been forgotten
by their descendants, they may not have been
of the less value to the world because of that
fact. A good name is sometimes better than
a notorious one, and an honest man, though
he may be soon forgotten, may be greater
than a dishonest man whose name is frequently
mentioned. Few of us would desire
to be like Benedict Arnold, although his
name is a very familiar one to all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see any use in staying here," said
Tom at last. "It's wet inside the barn, and
it can't be much worse outside. Why don't
we start on?"</p>

<p>Now that he was so near to the American
army, the lad was eager to go forward. All
his dreams and visions of the forces which
were fighting against the redcoats came back
to him, and his impatience to proceed increased
each moment. Perhaps the sight and
presence of Captain Molly, as well as the
account the young lieutenant had given of
her, had created a still greater desire in Tom's
heart to quit the place; but, be that as it
may, he was ready to go, and apparently his
companion shared in his feeling.</p>

<p>"If you think your horse will stand up for
a mile, we might do as you say," replied the
lieutenant. "I think we'll be going on,"
he added, turning to the men as he spoke.
"I've some important information to give
the general, and as I don't see any signs of
the rain stopping, I think we ought not to
delay longer. We can't be much worse off
than we are now."</p>

<p>"Sure, and ye'll not be after goin' out in
such a storm as this!" protested Molly. "It
would be a shame to take that poor baste out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
into the rain now. He has all he can do to
stand up in the barn, to say nothin' of havin'
to be carryin' a load. It's the last drop
that'll be after breakin' of his back, yez
know."</p>

<p>The men all laughed at the woman's words,
but the lieutenant was not to be deterred,
and accordingly the horses were brought
forth and the two men speedily mounted.
Tom's horse was limping painfully when he
started, and as the lad glanced backward he
could see Captain Molly standing in the doorway,
her hands resting upon her hips, and her
broad, freckled face beaming with delight
over the sorry spectacle he was well aware
that he presented.</p>

<p>A feeling of disgust arose in his heart as
he watched her. Surely she must be lacking
in all the qualities which he had most honored
in the women he knew. Coarseness was in
place of delicacy, boldness instead of modesty,
and her entire bearing was such that Tom
never afterwards could hear her name mentioned
without expressing his disgust. Not
even the bravery of the deed which Captain
Molly Pitcher did not many hours after this
time, and which Tom Coward himself witnessed,
entirely banished the prejudice which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
he entertained against the coarse, good-natured,
manly, unwomanly woman.</p>

<p>The storm had ceased when, after a short
ride, Tom and his companion first came
within sight of the American army. All the
long pent-up hopes of the lad were now about
to be fulfilled, and for the first time in his
life he was to look upon the men whose
names and deeds had long been familiar to
him. His eagerness brought a smile to his
companion's face, but while he watched the
lad he did not speak.</p>

<p>Molly Pitcher had spoken truly, and the
American army had halted after a brief
march from Kingston in the preceding night,
and now were compelled to remain during the
entire day in Cranberry. Only the advance
corps had moved forward, and at that time
were holding a position on the road to Monmouth
Court House and within five miles of
the rear of the British.</p>

<p>In spite of his own excitement, and that
which was apparent among the men in the
camp when Tom and the lieutenant entered,
the lad's first feeling was one of keen disappointment.
Were these the men of whom he
had heard so much and from whom so much
was expected? Mud-stained, worn by their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
recent exertions, plainly showing the effects
of the intense heat, many of them without
uniforms, some hatless and coatless, to the
vision of Tom Coward they presented far
more the appearance of a mob than of the
orderly and well-trained soldiers he had expected
to see.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant had left him as soon
as they entered the camp, leading the two
horses away with him,&mdash;a fact over which
Tom did not long lament, we may be sure. An
hour passed before the young officer returned,
for he was to make a report of all that he
had learned, and Tom's hopes were not
strengthened as he watched the men about
him during his companion's absence.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gordon noticed the expression
upon Tom's face when he rejoined him, but,
attributing it to the fear which he supposed
the lad felt, he did not refer to it, and in the
labors which soon followed no opportunity to
explain was given by either.</p>

<p>General Dickinson, with the New Jersey
militia, was not with the main body, as we
already know, and Tom found that he could
not be assigned to them. Through the lieutenant's
influence, he was to be retained with
the main body, and to assist in serving as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
a guide for the army, an office which Tom
was well fitted to hold, although it was not
just in accord with the plans he had formed
in his own mind.</p>

<p>Reports came into the camp during the
day which clearly indicated that the advance
corps was too far away to be properly supported
at once in the present condition of the
roads. But on Saturday morning Lafayette,
with his troops, was ordered to file off by his
left towards Englishtown, and in the same
day the main body, under General Washington,
marched out from Cranberry and encamped
within three miles of the place.</p>

<p>This brought the two opposing armies
now within eight miles of each other, while
General Lee's forces, five thousand strong,
without Morgan's dragoons or the New Jersey
militia, were three miles nearer the British.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of affairs on that
night of Saturday, June 27 (1778), and
Tom Coward, as well as many of the men
in Washington's army, slept but little, with
the knowledge that on the morrow the long
delayed battle would doubtless be begun.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AN INTERRUPTED JOURNEY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> surprise of Little Peter at the unexpected
action of Benzeor was increased when
the escaping man seated himself in the whaleboat
and quickly began to row the long craft
back toward the Washington.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the redcoats! Hurrah for
King George! Hurrah for the British!"
shouted Benzeor defiantly.</p>

<p>This boldness was as surprising to Peter as
the sudden departure had been; but, as he
glanced toward the Washington and saw that
the attacking party had already boarded her,
and then realized that he himself had been
left alone by his recent companions, he was
quickly recalled to the necessity of action on
his own part. Without waiting to observe
the further movements of Benzeor or the
British, he instantly turned and entered the
woods; but a quarter of an hour had elapsed
before he overtook the men, whom he found
resting by the side of the road which led past
the home of Ted Wilson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>To this house the entire party now made
their way, and as Ted listened to the story
of Benzeor's perfidy, his anger broke forth
afresh.</p>

<p>"I never ought to have let the rascal go!"
exclaimed Ted excitedly. "I had him right
there in the river, and if you hadn't interfered
with me I'd have fixed him so that he
never would have betrayed any one again.
Now the rascal's where he can keep up his
evil doings."</p>

<p>"He's shown where he stands, any way.
That's some comfort," said one of the men.</p>

<p>"It may comfort you, but it doesn't me,"
replied Ted. "I'm a peaceable man, I am,
and I never cared much about whether it was
to be the King of England or the Continental
Congress that ruled over me. I don't see as
it would make very much difference to me,
for my part. But when that rascal hangs my
Sallie up on the limb of a tree,&mdash;Sallie's
my wife, ye know,&mdash;why, then Benzeor Osburn
has jest got to look out for himself."</p>

<p>Ted's anger was so evident that Little
Peter almost had a feeling of sympathy for
Benzeor, angry as he himself was at the
treachery his neighbor had displayed.</p>

<p>"Are you going to follow him up, Ted?"
inquired the leader.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"Am I goin' to follow him? That's just
what I'm going to do! I'm goin' to send
Sallie and the babies over to your house, and
I'm just goin' to leave my place here,&mdash;they
can't steal that, any way,&mdash;and follow up
Benzeor Osburn till I find him. I don't care
if he runs clear to the other side of the Alleghany
Mountains,&mdash;I've heard as how there
was some mountains by that name away out
west somewhere,&mdash;why, Benzeor'll wake up
some fine mornin' and find himself a-shakin'
hands with me. Yes, sir, this land o' ours
may put up with the Hessians, but it isn't
big enough to hold such a fellow as Benzeor!
Hangin' Sallies! I'll put a stop to his fine
work! Sallie's my wife, ye know!"</p>

<p>"Remember us to him when you meet him,
Ted," said the leader. "You can charge
him for the loss of the Washington, too!"</p>

<p>"His door will be free of all chalk scores
when I'm done with him," said Ted savagely.
"That's goin' to be my work, clearin' the
land of pine robbers, just as I once cleared it
of pine stumps!"</p>

<p>"We must start on now," said the leader.
"Take your wife and children up to my
house, Ted. The women can fight together
against the pine robbers, if they come there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"They won't come there," replied Ted.
"There'll be fewer of 'em when I've done
my duty. There'll be no more hangin' Sallies.
Sallie's my wife, ye know."</p>

<p>"I suspected as much from your words,"
said the leader. "Are you going with us?"
he added, turning, as he spoke, to Little Peter.</p>

<p>"No," replied the lad.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now? You
can't get your father out of the New York
prisons. You'd better come with us."</p>

<p>"I can't. I've other work to do."</p>

<p>"Have it your own way, my lad, though I
think you're making a mistake not to come
with us."</p>

<p>The band soon departed, leaving Little
Peter and the huge Ted behind them. There
was slight likelihood that the men who had
captured the Washington would venture on
shore to pursue the fugitives, and the knowledge
of this fact had made all the parties
feel comparatively safe.</p>

<p>"What are you goin' to do now?" said
Ted, when he and Little Peter were left
alone.</p>

<p>"I'm going straight to Benzeor's house.
After what I have just seen, I'm afraid to
leave the children there another minute. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
never would have thought Benzeor was a
traitor, never! But he is, there's no doubt
about it now! I don't know what will become
of them. I don't know where to turn,
or what to do."</p>

<p>Little Peter then went on to relate the
story of the sad loss which had occurred in
his home, Ted listening meanwhile with intense
interest.</p>

<p>"It's Benzeor's work!" he said excitedly
when the lad at last stopped. "Yes, sir!
You mark my words, Benzeor Osburn was at
the bottom of it all. You'll have to go in
with me and help rid the land of him! The
rascal! Goin' round hangin' Sallies and
shootin' mothers!"</p>

<p>"I've all I want to do to look after my
little brothers and sisters," said Little Peter
quietly. "I don't know what I can do with
them, but I can't leave them at Benzeor's!"</p>

<p>"No more you can't," said Ted. "I'll
tell you what to do with 'em. Jest bring
'em all down here and leave 'em with Sallie
over at the captain's. I think they'll be safe
enough there."</p>

<p>"Thank you; but it's most too far to bring
them, I'm afraid. It's a good twenty miles
from here, and we haven't a horse left."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I could let ye have one, but all of
mine are gone too, except one little mule;
and you'd have to turn him round and make
him go backward if you wanted to go anywhere,
he's such an obstinate little beast.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Peter! Just as
soon as I've taken Sallie&mdash;she's my wife,
ye know&mdash;and the babies over to the captain's,
I'll go with ye and help ye out.
That's what I'll do for ye."</p>

<p>"Thank you again," replied Peter, "but I
don't think you had better do it. You may
be needed around here, and I don't know yet
what I shall do."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right, Peter, maybe you're
right. Well, have it your own way. When
are you goin' to start?"</p>

<p>"Right away."</p>

<p>Little Peter at once bade his friend good-by
and started forth on his long walk. He
had appreciated the offer of the mighty Ted,
but there were many reasons why he wished
to be alone, for a time at least. Benzeor's
treachery was still so fresh in his mind that
he knew not what to do, and the excitement
attending the escape from the Washington
had not yet disappeared. Then, too, he did
not know what the angry giant might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
moved to do. Ordinarily good-natured and
easy-going as the powerful man was, when
once his wrath was aroused there would be
no limits to what it might lead him into.
And Little Peter's heart was too heavy, under
the burden of his recent sorrows and present
perplexities, to permit the lad to be drawn
aside from the task which had presented itself
to him.</p>

<p>He had gone about half the way down the
long lane which led from Ted's house to the
road, when he heard some one calling to him.
Looking quickly behind him, he discovered
Ted himself running rapidly down the path
toward him.</p>

<p>Startled by the sight and fearful that some
new danger had appeared, he stopped, and
then turned back to meet the man.</p>

<p>"What is it? What is it?" he called.</p>

<p>Ted stopped as the lad called, and, shaking
one of his great fists in the air, replied,
"Hangin' Sallies! Hangin' Sallies!"</p>

<p>"What? Have they tried it again?"</p>

<p>"No! Once was enough, I should think,
when Sallie's my wife, ye know! I just
wanted to remind ye what the password was.
It's 'Hangin' Sallies,' that's what it is! Ye
won't forget it, will ye?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," replied Peter soberly. "I'll try to
keep it in mind."</p>

<p>"That's right! See that ye do! Hangin'
Sallies, that's the word. I jest wanted to
remind ye of it, that was all. Hangin' Sallies!
Hangin' Sallies!"</p>

<p>Little Peter resumed his journey, but, until
he passed around the bend in the road, whenever
he looked behind him he could see the
mighty Ted standing in the lane, and shaking
his fist in the air if he perceived that the lad
beheld him.</p>

<p>What a strange man Ted was, thought
Little Peter as he walked on. He had known
him for years, as had most of the people in
Old Monmouth. His feats in the country
wrestling matches had made him famous, and
marvelous were the tales told concerning his
almost superhuman strength. It had been
related that Ted one time had lifted a great
ox bodily from the ground, and Little Peter
had believed the report. And yet, with it all,
Ted had always seemed to him like a boy.
Kind-hearted, ever willing to grant a favor or
do anything within his power for another, he
had never before seen him when his wrath
was kindled. "Hanging Sallies!" Perhaps
Ted's feelings were only natural when he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
discovered the pine robbers in their cruel act.
Benzeor would not be likely to escape from
his hands so easily, if the angry man once
held him in his grasp again.</p>

<p>But Sallie Wilson was still alive, and the
lad thought Ted's position was far better
than his own. His mother shot by the pine
robbers, his father sent away a prisoner, perhaps
to die of starvation in those dreadful
prison ships of which so many stories already
had been told, and his younger brothers and
sisters homeless and helpless, and all looking
to him as their sole support. What could he
do? Surely no one in Old Monmouth had
suffered more than he, although Old Monmouth
itself had known more of the evils of
war than almost any other portion of our land
in all that fearful struggle of the American
Revolution.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>Little Peter's meditations were suddenly
interrupted by Indian John, who stepped
forth into the road and greeted him with his
customary salutation.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from, John? I
thought you were up in Moluss's wigwam."</p>

<p>"Moluss gone, Bath gone, John gone, too.
Come to help friend. Find fader?" he suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
added, peering keenly, as he spoke, into
Little Peter's face.</p>

<p>"No; my father has been sent to New
York."</p>

<p>"Bad. What boy do now?"</p>

<p>"I'm going back to Benzeor's to look after
the children."</p>

<p>The Indian's eyes betrayed the question he
might have asked, but did not. Indian John
soon induced his companion to abandon the
road and follow him through the forests.
Many a mile was saved in this manner, and,
under the burning heat of the sun, the shade
of the great trees was most grateful to the
sadly troubled lad. There was something
in the presence of the majestic trees which
seemed to appeal to Little Peter. He was
alone and yet not alone with such companions.
Indian John also seemed to share in his feelings,
and seldom spoke. For mile after mile
they continued on their journey, and the
shadows were lengthening when at last they
stepped forth into the road, which Peter recognized,
and then knew that Benzeor's house
was not far away. The long journey would
soon be ended now, and fresh hope came to
the weary lad, as he thought that he would
see the children again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>What he should do with them, however,
was a problem still unsolved, and the solution
apparently was no nearer than when he had
set forth on his journey from the home of
Ted Wilson. With all of the anger which
had come with the discovery of Benzeor's
treachery, Little Peter could not bring himself
to believe that either Sarah or her mother
had any knowledge of his evil deeds. His
confidence in them was still unbroken, and
his sole hope was that they might be able
to suggest some plan by which the children
could be cared for. As for leaving them at
Benzeor's, that was impossible; and as the
lad thought again of the discovery of his
neighbor's crimes, he quickened his pace,
and he and his companion began to walk
more rapidly along the hot and dusty road.
Not more than two miles remained between
them and the end of their journey, and, in
his eagerness, Little Peter almost forgot his
weariness and constantly urged the Indian
by his side to increase their speed.</p>

<p>They had been in the road but a few minutes
when they heard the sound of horsemen
approaching from behind them. All unsuspicious
of danger, Little Peter and Indian
John halted, waiting for the men to pass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
There were five of them in the band, and all
were riding swiftly. Their horses were dripping,
and with almost every step flung the
foam from their mouths. Surely something
must be wrong, to induce men to ride like
that upon such a warm day, thought Little
Peter; but his surmises were quickly driven
from his mind when he recognized Fenton
and Benzeor in advance of the band.</p>

<p>Startled by the unexpected sight, he hardly
knew what to do. The men were too near
for him to hope to escape their notice now;
and, even while he hesitated, he saw Benzeor
quickly draw the rein on the horse he was
riding and leap to the ground.</p>

<p>"Get him! Shoot him! Stop that boy!"
shouted Benzeor.</p>

<p>Indian John had been keenly watching the
approaching band, and as he heard the shout
of the angry man, he touched Peter upon the
arm, and said, "Come."</p>

<p>Little Peter instantly responded, and followed
his companion as he started swiftly
across the open lot toward the woods which
lay beyond it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE ABODE OF INDIAN JOHN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pursuit of Little Peter and Indian
John was not long continued, nor was a single
gun discharged; a fact for which the frightened
lad was unable to account at the time,
although on the following morning the cause
for it was made clear.</p>

<p>Wearied though the lad was by his long
journey, the shout of Benzeor had provided
an impulse sufficiently strong to compel him
to keep up with his companion, who was running
swiftly toward the shelter of the woods
which were not far away.</p>

<p>In a brief time the breathless fugitives
gained its shelter, and then for the first time
turned and glanced behind them. The men
had turned back and now could be seen still
standing by the roadside, near the place
where Peter and the Indian had started
across the lot. What they were doing could
not be discovered; but, without waiting for
further investigations, the flight was at once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
resumed, and, keeping well together, the lad
and his companion ran swiftly forward, and
soon the distance between them and the pine
robbers had been still further increased.</p>

<p>The sunlight had now departed from the
forest, and the dusk had settled over all. The
air was close and oppressive, and Peter's dripping
face betrayed the force of his recent
exertions and the excitement under which he
was laboring. Already the night birds had
made their appearance, and here and there
among the branches of the lofty trees the
bats could be seen darting about in quest of
their evening meal. The very silence served
to increase the feeling of utter loneliness
which swept over the weary, heartbroken lad,
and for a moment it almost seemed to him as
if any further efforts on his part were as useless
as they were difficult. Benzeor's anger
promised little good for the children who had
been left in his home, and fears for his little
brothers and sisters were mingled in Little
Peter's mind with the consciousness of his
own weariness and the thought of his own
forlorn condition.</p>

<p>Difficult as the problem doubtless was, he
knew he must not give way to it, and when
Indian John indicated in a few moments that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the time had come when they must go on, the
lad resolutely again turned to follow him,
although he had not the slightest conception
of the plan which was in his companion's
mind.</p>

<p>Carefully they walked on through the increasing
gloom, and within a half hour Little
Peter heard the sounds of a running brook
in the distance. He instantly recognized the
locality, for many a time had he and Tom
in the springtime followed the course of the
"run," as the people of Old Monmouth called
the stream, and the strings of fish which they
had brought home with them had borne ample
witness to the success which had crowned
their efforts.</p>

<p>But none of these things were in Little
Peter's mind as he followed Indian John,
who had now turned and was proceeding along
the bank and making his way up the stream.
As they walked on, the sound of a waterfall
began to be more and more distinctly heard,
and soon they came out into a place from
which, in the deepening gloom, the falling
waters could be seen. Into the basin which
had been formed by the sharp fall of the
stream, a tall, large tree had fallen years before
this time. Its broken roots had torn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
up the earth, and now stood like a barrier
on the bank, and Indian John led the way
directly toward this spot.</p>

<p>As they approached, Peter discovered a
hole in the rocks, but he was not prepared
for the action of his companion; for, without
a word, the Indian dropped upon his hands
and knees and crawled into the entrance and
speedily disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>Hesitating only a moment, Little Peter
soon followed his companion, and after crawling
along on his hands and knees for a number
of yards, suddenly beheld a large, open
space directly before him. Indian John had
provided a light by this time, for he had been
willing to follow the customs of his more
civilized neighbors to the extent of making
use of candles, and as Peter arose and glanced
about him, he knew at once that he was in
the cave which it was reported was the abode
of the red man.</p>

<p>Frequently as the lad had passed the very
place into which he had crawled that night,
it had never occurred to him that it was anything
more than a hole in the rocks that
formed the bank of the "run," and his surprise
was therefore the greater at the sight
before him. The spot was considerably above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the bed of the stream, and consequently was
comparatively dry. Straw and dry leaves lay
scattered about over the floor, and the sheltered
place apparently was safe from all approach
or danger.</p>

<p>Indian John at once indicated to his companion
that he was to pass the night there,
and the weary lad was glad to accept the
invitation, and soon stretched himself upon
the bed of straw. The light of the candle
was extinguished, and the Indian then speedily
followed the example of Peter. The sounds
of the running brook came faintly to the
ears of the troubled lad, but that was all he
could hear. The darkness was intense, and
for a time the fear of other occupants of
various kinds prevented Peter from sleeping,
but at last even that was forgotten in the
dreamless sleep that followed.</p>

<p>When he awoke, Little Peter at first could
not determine where he was, but as the outlines
of the cave were seen in the dim light
which penetrated it, the experiences of the
preceding day were recalled, and he quickly
arose. Indian John was not in the cave,
however, and as the lad now was aware that
the morning had come, he hastily crawled
through the passageway that led to the bank.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>As he regained the bank, he saw that his
companion was busily engaged in roasting
some birds he had shot. The sight was a
welcome one, for Peter was now aware of
the fact that he was decidedly hungry, and,
following his companion's advice, he departed
in search of some berries to add to the morning
meal. In the course of a half hour he
returned with his hat well filled, and, after
bathing his hands and face in the cool waters
of the brook, prepared at once to join his
companion.</p>

<p>For a few minutes neither spoke, but the
rapid manner in which the roasted birds disappeared
showed that conversation was not
uppermost in their minds.</p>

<p>At last, when several of the birds had been
eaten, and many of the berries had disappeared,
Indian John turned to his companion
and said, "Boy want 'hop-hop' now? Plenty
'hop-hop.' Make um good."</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Peter quickly. "The
birds are enough. Where did you get them,
John?"</p>

<p>"Shoot um. Plenty birds; plenty 'hop-hop.'"</p>

<p>"You must have been up early this morning,
John. I didn't hear you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indian made no reply and remained
silent for several minutes. Then, turning abruptly
and looking keenly at Peter, he said,
"What boy do now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Little Peter disconsolately.</p>

<p>The words brought him face to face again
with the problem that must be solved. The
fresh cool air of the morning, the silence of
the forest, and, above all, the enjoyment of
the breakfast which John had provided, made
him at first wish that he might remain there
and forget all the troubles that were so near.
But Peter was not a selfish lad, and knew
that the motherless children must be provided
for.</p>

<p>"I was going to Benzeor's," he said after
a time, "but I don't know what to do now.
I can't understand what he meant by coming
back here in broad daylight after what has
happened. He knows that I know all about
it, and that was the reason why he wanted
to catch me last night. I can't go up to his
house now, and yet I don't dare leave the
children there, either."</p>

<p>"Boy go," said Indian John quietly.</p>

<p>"But I can't go, John. How can I?
There were four men with Benzeor, and you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
heard what he said. It wouldn't be safe for
me to go there now. I don't know what to
do."</p>

<p>"Boy go; Benzeor no there."</p>

<p>"Benzeor not there? How do you know?
What makes you think that, John?"</p>

<p>"John been there."</p>

<p>"When? This morning?"</p>

<p>The Indian nodded his head, and then
said, "Man no there. Girl there. Two, t'ree
little Peters there. Boy go. All safe."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it?" said Peter eagerly,
and standing erect as he spoke. "Come on,
then, John; we'll start this minute."</p>

<p>"Boy go; Indian no go."</p>

<p>"Why not? I thought you were going
with me."</p>

<p>"John no go. John no home, no papoose,
no notin'. All white man now. All
gone. Indian no stay. Boy go."</p>

<p>"All right, John; I won't urge you. But
if you're right, and Benzeor isn't at home,
you needn't be afraid."</p>

<p>The Indian's eyes snapped at the words,
but he made no reply, and Little Peter was
too eager to start now to realize the force of
his own words. As he departed, he saw his
recent companion standing on the bank of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the brook in an attitude as if he were listening
to sounds far off in the forest. Perhaps
if the lad had realized that it was the last
time he would ever behold the face of Indian
John, he would have lingered longer; but, as
it was, his desire to go to Benzeor's house
and learn of the present condition of the children
banished all other thoughts from his
mind, and in a few moments he had started
toward the road.</p>

<p>He retraced his way across the open lot,
and as he came within sight of the road he
suddenly stopped, as he saw a mounted man
there. Apparently the man was alone, and
what was strange was the fact that he apparently
was not moving.</p>

<p>Little Peter waited several minutes, but as
the man still retained his position, and no
one joined him, he resolved to proceed. Approaching
cautiously, and ready to run at the
first appearance of danger, his surprise was
increased as he beheld the strange manner in
which the horseman was seated on his beast.
Instead of sitting with his face toward the
head of his steed, his position was exactly
reversed, and to all appearances he either was
going in a direction opposite to that of his
horse or else was riding backward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>Puzzled to account for the strange attitude,
Peter also noticed as he approached that the
beast on which the man was mounted was a
mule and had stopped in the middle of the
road. In a moment he recognized the man as
Ted Wilson, and with a shout he ran forward.</p>

<p>"Why, my lad, what are you doing here?"
exclaimed Ted, as he beheld the approaching
boy.</p>

<p>"It's more to the point to ask what you
are doing here. What are you sitting on
that mule that way for? What have you
stopped for? Why don't you go ahead?"</p>

<p>"There are several good reasons," replied
Ted blandly. "In the first place, if the
mule won't go, I can't go. Then, if he stops,
I have to stop, too. As to the reason for my
being here, why, I'm looking for Benzeor."</p>

<p>"I don't know where you expect to find
him," laughed Peter&mdash;forgetting his own
anxiety for the moment in the ludicrous sight
before him.</p>

<p>"Well, I got to thinking of it yesterday
after you left me; and when I'd taken Sallie
and the babies up to the captain's,&mdash;Sallie's
my wife, ye know,&mdash;I jest made up my mind
as how I'd got to look after Benzeor afore
he did any more damage. Goin' around the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
country hangin' Sallies! The rascal! Old
Monmouth never'll be safe till Benzeor
Osburn has been 'tended to. And if I'm
not the man to do it, I don't know who is.
So Jeshurun and I decided to start out last
night, and we've been travelin' ever since."</p>

<p>"Jeshurun? I don't see anybody with
you," said Peter, glancing quickly about him
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Ted. "Ye're lookin'
too far afield, young man. This here
fellow's Jeshurun. Whoa, Jesh! Whoa!"
he suddenly added, as the mule darted to one
side and turned several circles in the road
before his rider could stop him.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; this is Jeshurun, and a more
onery little beast never lived. I told ye
about him yesterday, and how he'd suddenly
take it into his head to go backwards for a
bit. That's the reason I ride him this way
part of the time. He thinks I want to go
the other way, ye see, and that's how I come
it over him by jest sittin' the wrong way, too.
Besides, a good twist of his tail is worth more
than a bridle sometimes. Instead of controllin'
him with a bridle, as any decent beast
would be glad to have me do, I just have to
steer him by twistin' his tail, same's I use the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
rudder in my boat, ye see. Whoa there,
Jesh! Whoa there! What's the matter
with ye, anyhow? Whoa! Whoa!"</p>

<p>These last remarks of Ted were caused by
a sudden movement on the part of Jeshurun,
whose heels were thrown into the air, while
with his teeth he almost literally bit the dust.
The mule was small and the feet of his rider
almost touched the ground, and the antics of
the pair caused Peter to laugh aloud.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that name for him?"
he inquired when quiet was restored.</p>

<p>"Oh, it came to him jest natural like.
Two years ago when I bought him, and was
a-leadin' him home, I got him into the yard
and then he just began to make his heels fly
like a pair o' drumsticks. It's likely there
was some noise made by him or me, I don't
jest know which, and the first thing I knew,
Sallie&mdash;she's my wife, ye know&mdash;and a
whole lot o' folks came a-runnin' out o' the
house to see what all the rumpus was about.
They was havin' meetin' in the house, though
I didn't know anything about that, or I
wouldn't have argued with the mule as I was
doin', o' course. Well, sir, if you'd believe
it, the parson had been a-preachin' about
somebody in the Old Testament. His text<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
was: 'But Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked:
thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick,
thou art covered with fatness.' Yes, sir;
those were his very words. Well, when
Sallie&mdash;she's my wife, ye know&mdash;set eyes
on this here beast, she said Jeshurun should
be his name, and Jeshurun it's been ever
since. Whoa there! Whoa, I say! What
ye up to now?"</p>

<p>Perhaps Jeshurun objected to the story, for
he suddenly whirled about and started swiftly
up the road. In vain Ted tried to restrain
him, but after his attempts failed, he turned
and shouted, "I'll see you farther on!
Jesh'll get tired o' this."</p>

<p>As Jeshurun and his rider disappeared in a
cloud of dust, Little Peter quickly recovered
from his surprise and started briskly after
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT FIGHT</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning of Sunday, June 28, 1778,
dawned clear and warm. Not a cloud could
be seen in the sky, and the air was motionless,
save in occasional places where it quivered
under the burning heat of the summer sun.
By eight o'clock the thermometer already
had indicated ninety-six degrees, and before
the day was done it had risen considerably
above a hundred.</p>

<p>The British forces had now arrived within
ten or twelve miles of the Heights of Middletown,
and if once they should succeed in gaining
that position, all attempts on the part of
the Americans to attack them would be worse
than useless, for it was now as well known by
Washington as it was by Clinton that British
vessels were lying at anchor off Sandy Hook,
ready and waiting to receive the advancing
army and its stores on board, and transport
all in safety to New York.</p>

<p>Clinton, as we already know, still believed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
that the Americans were seeking only to capture
his stores and train of baggage wagons,
and, therefore, wisely had placed them
in the care of General Knyphausen and the
Hessian soldiers, in advance of the place of
danger, as he supposed, and also of the place
where the brave leader himself took his stand
with his men. All of the British grenadiers,
light infantry, and chasseurs of the line were
encamped in the strong position that Clinton
had selected in the parting of the road which
led from Monmouth Court House to Middletown,
the right wing extending about a mile
and a half beyond the court house itself, while
the left lay stretched for three miles along
the road from Allentown. Thick woods afforded
strong protection to the flanks, while
a swamp extended toward the rear and the
left, and woods also covered their front. The
British general had chosen his place wisely,
and there he waited until that eventful Sunday
morning.</p>

<p>General Washington was well aware of all
that was going on, and had determined to
attack the British the moment they moved
from the position they then occupied. Late
on Saturday night, the commander had given
orders for General Maxwell to send out parties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
of observation, who were to watch the British
and report instantly any signs they might
discover of an attempt to retreat during the
night, and to keep up a constant communication
with himself. General orders had also
been given Lee to be prepared to attack Clinton's
forces the moment they should depart
from their camping-place.</p>

<p>General Lee's treachery or incompetency,
or both, are well known to-day, and the only
cause of surprise is that General Washington
should have given him such discretionary
orders. The great commander must have
been fully aware of Lee's true feelings, for
already he had suffered much from his jealousy
and his traitorous designs; but perhaps
the rest of the army did not know what
Washington himself well knew, and on the
eve of battle he chose the lesser of the two
evils, and thought he would suffer less by
permitting Lee to continue to act, than he
would from the misunderstanding and confusion
that might arise if he dealt with the
man at that time as he justly deserved. At
all events, his orders were somewhat general,
and the fact that he had not given specific
commands is all that remains to-day to be
quoted in favor of the guilty Lee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about five o'clock in the morning
when a messenger arrived in Washington's
camp from General Dickinson&mdash;who, with the
New Jersey militia, was nearest the enemy's
lines&mdash;with the information that the front of
the British line had begun its march toward
the Heights of Middletown. Instantly Washington's
army was put in motion, and one of
his aids was sent in all haste to inform General
Lee of the movement of the British, and
to urge him forward to attack them at once
unless some very strong obstacle should be
found, and to assure him that the main body
of the American army would be rushed forward
to his support.</p>

<p>I am very certain that if my readers could
somehow have been privileged to witness the
march of Washington's soldiers, they would
not have been greatly impressed by the sight.
Many of them were without uniforms, and
their flushed and streaming faces under the
burning heat, while they bore an expression
of determination, after all would not have
been very prepossessing in their appearance.
Numbers of the Continentals had either cast
aside their coats or rolled them up and
strapped them across their backs, so that
entire ranks appeared to be marching to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
battle in their shirt-sleeves. However, although
their personal bearing was not made
more forceful by the absence of coats, their
personal comfort was decidedly improved;
and, as we shall soon see, their work in the
battle was not hindered by their lack of
bright colored uniforms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the advanced corps under General
Lee had moved from Englishtown, and
was now advancing toward the British. The
redcoats were also in motion, and the left
wing had marched more than a mile beyond
Monmouth Court House when it discovered
that the American columns had out-flanked
it on the north. Lee's forces had
marched along the main road, successfully
crossing the deep ravines and causeways.
They had halted frequently to receive reports
from the scouts and the men in advance as
to the movements of the British, but these
reports apparently were somewhat contradictory
and created some confusion among the
American ranks.</p>

<p>One of these halts had been made near the
"new church," which was so called to distinguish
it from the smaller structure, which
until 1752 had stood upon the same site.
This "new church" was of wood, its sides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
covered with shingles, and painted white.
There such famous preachers as Whitefield,
the missionary Brainerd, Tennent, and others
had given their messages of peace, but it can
be safely asserted that in all its long history
the "old" church or the "new" had never
seen such a "service" as that which was held
there on that Sunday morning in June, 1778.
Before the day was done bullet marks and
the effect of cannon shot were apparent on
its walls, and while the roof and even the
steeple were said to have been covered with
people on that day, who had assembled to
watch the battle, probably no other congregation
in all our land had ever been gathered
by such summons, or had taken their seats
on the roof of the building instead of in the
accustomed place within the walls.</p>

<p>Young General Lafayette, who had command
of Lee's right, soon passed the Court
House, and was advancing upon the other end
of the British line on the south at the same
time when the left wing was folding about
Cornwallis on the north; and General Wayne,
who was in command of the American centre,
was also pressing strongly forward. Apparently,
all things were favoring the rugged
Continentals, and had it not been for Lee's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
cowardice or treachery, or both, they would
have won the battle there and then, before
Washington could come with the aid of his
advancing troops.</p>

<p>Some slight minor engagements had already
occurred, though not one of them was of
much importance; but now General Wayne
discovered that most of the British forces
before him had descended from the high
ground they had occupied and were advancing
along the same route, over the plains of
Monmouth, which the Hessians had followed
when they departed earlier in the morning.</p>

<p>Instantly the impetuous Wayne sent a messenger
to General Lee requesting permission
for his own "troops to be pressed on." No
such permission was given, however, until it
was discovered that a band of eight or nine
hundred of the redcoats had halted, and, turning
about, appeared to be inviting an attack.
General Wayne was then ordered to take
about four hundred men and advance.</p>

<p>Despite the smallness of the number,
Wayne eagerly obeyed, when the Queen's
light dragoons were sent back by Clinton to
check the movement.</p>

<p>So excited was the little band of Americans
that they instantly formed, and drove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the horsemen back upon a body of foot soldiers
who had been sent to their aid. A
much larger body of troops were soon discovered
to be moving upon General Wayne's
right, but he immediately opened fire upon
them with the two pieces of artillery he possessed,
sent back for reinforcements, and
gallantly prepared for the battle.</p>

<p>During this time General Lee apparently
was trying to cut off the force with which
Wayne was engaged by making a detour and
falling upon the line of Clinton's march between
the rear of the main body and that
detachment.</p>

<p>This action of Lee's, together with those
which three of the others of the divisions
of the American forces were making at the
same time, led Clinton to suppose that his
baggage train was what the Americans were
striving to gain. As we already know, this,
all the time, had been his understanding of
the purpose of Washington, and now the
action and movements of the various bodies
of troops strengthened his suspicion.</p>

<p>The first thing the British commander did
was to send the Queen's light dragoons against
Wayne. Then he sent a detachment from
the men in advance to strengthen his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
right, and next he arranged for the main body,
of which Lord Cornwallis was in command,
to form on the plain and prepare to attack
General Lee and the various divisions which
were under him at the time.</p>

<p>General Wayne and his brave men were
now fighting desperately, and to all appearances
success was about to crown his efforts,
when he was dumfounded by an order he
received from Lee to make only a feigned
attack, and not to press too hard against the
redcoats in front of him.</p>

<p>Wayne did not know what to make of the
order. He was chagrined and angry to receive
such a word at a time when all things seemed
to favor his determined band. It is said that
he made use of some very forceful language,
and even expressed his opinion of his superior
officer in no very complimentary terms; but
he was too good a soldier not to obey; and,
although he could not understand what Lee
meant by giving him such directions at such
a time, he held back his men, hoping all the
time that Lee himself would come up and
grasp the victory which almost seemed to be
in his hand.</p>

<p>General Lee had been watching the movements
of the British, and perceived what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Clinton was trying to do by the actions to
which we already have referred. Instead of
meeting them boldly, and permitting his soldiers,
who were all now eager for the battle,
to advance, he at once prepared to withdraw
them from the field.</p>

<p>Young Lafayette had just discovered a
body of British cavalry advancing toward
Lee's right, and, quickly riding up to his
commander, he begged for permission to advance
and gain their rear, and so cut them
off from the main body.</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Lee, "you do not know
British soldiers. We cannot stand against
them. We shall certainly be driven back at
first, and we must be cautious."</p>

<p>"It may be so, general," said Lafayette
quietly, "but British soldiers have been
beaten, and they may be again. At any rate
I am disposed to make the trial."</p>

<p>Reluctantly Lee yielded, so far as to permit
the brave young marquis to wheel his column
by the right and make an attempt to gain
the left of the British, but at the same time
he ordered three regiments to be withdrawn
from Wayne's command, thereby weakening
him for reasons which neither Wayne nor any
one of his men ever understood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>General Lee then rode off to reconnoitre,
as he afterwards declared, and to his astonishment
discovered another large body of
British soldiers marching back on the Middletown
road toward the Court House. If there
was one thing more than another which Lee
apparently disliked at that time, it was the
sight and presence of men clad in scarlet
coats, and he instantly gave orders for the
several corps in his division to retreat, or to
make a "retrograde movement," as he afterwards
explained it.</p>

<p>His friends claimed for him, and, indeed,
Lee afterwards claimed for himself, that he
had only ordered the right to fall back, and
had commanded the left, under Scott and
Maxwell, to advance, and his order was misunderstood;
and that when Maxwell's men
perceived the retreat of their comrades on
the left, they thought all was ended and they
must save themselves. But, at all events,
proof of the truthfulness of his statement
was wanting, and all his men were soon retreating
toward the "new meeting-house," on
the roof and steeple of which were assembled
the people of the congregation.</p>

<p>Few of the men beside Lee himself knew
why the retreat was made. The soldiers were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
angry and were giving vent to their feelings
in terms which had not been carefully selected.
General Wayne's men were the only ones
who had even fired a shot, and the anger
of Wayne himself was steadily increasing.
Every soldier felt as if he were being robbed
of success, which by right belonged to him
and to his country.</p>

<p>Between the "meeting-house" and the
parsonage, General Washington, all unaware
of Lee's disgraceful actions and the retreat of
the advanced division, met a fifer, who appeared
to be in great haste to leave the region.</p>

<p>Reining in his horse, the great commander
ordered the fleeing man to halt, and then said
sternly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you? Do you belong to the
army? Why are you running in this fashion?"</p>

<p>"I am a soldier," replied the trembling
man, "but all the Continentals are running,
too."</p>

<p>"It isn't true! It can't be true! I'll
have you whipped if you dare to mention
such a thing to another living man!" cried
the astonished commander.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he put the spurs to his horse,
and in a few minutes discovered two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
other men, who apparently were in as great
haste to depart as the fifer had been.</p>

<p>Instantly the trembling men halted at his
sharp command, and again the excited general
demanded an explanation of their actions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BATTLE OF MONMOUTH</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Evidently</span>, the reply which General Washington
received from the men, who were as
greatly frightened by the bearing of the commander
as they had been by the sight of the
redcoats, did not convince him that they had
spoken truly. He had not heard any firing,
except that of a few cannon a considerable
time before this, and he could not believe
that the picked men under Lee's command
had ingloriously retreated without making
even an attempt to stand against the forces
of Sir Henry Clinton.</p>

<p>This second report, however, caused Washington
to send forward two of his trusty
officers, whom he ordered to ride swiftly in
the direction of the Court House, and, after
they should have discovered the true condition
of affairs, to report instantly to him.</p>

<p>As the two brave men quickly obeyed and
started their horses into a run, they met on
the bridge the members of a regiment in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
disorderly retreat. A little farther on another
regiment was discovered, and soon still another
appeared in sight.</p>

<p>Colonel Ogden, who was in command of
the last, in a towering passion declared, in
reply to the question of the officers, that
Lee's men were indeed retreating and that
"they were flying from a shadow."</p>

<p>Still hoping that they would find that a
stand had been made farther back, the two
officers pushed eagerly forward and soon met
General Maxwell and his men. That gallant
officer was also in a state of great anger, and
not only confirmed the report that Lee was
retreating, but also added some words of his
own, expressing his opinion of that officer and
of the movement in words that would have
caused the cheeks of the treacherous general
to tingle, if he had chanced to hear them.</p>

<p>Still hoping against hope, the two aids
pressed forward and soon met General Lee
himself. His face at all times was decidedly
plain, and indeed, as we know, he had the
reputation of having the "ugliest face in
America;" but at this time a scowl rested
upon it which doubtless did not tend to increase
his beauty, and he sullenly refused to
reply to the questions of the men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>The two officers did not long delay to talk
to him, but still urged their horses swiftly
forward, although the straggling, disorderly
troops now almost filled the road, and their
worst fears were confirmed each moment.</p>

<p>At last, in the post of danger and nearest
to the pursuing British, the two officers discovered
General Wayne and his men. "Mad
Anthony" was certainly "mad" at that time,
and while he assured the aids that the retreat
was genuine and general, at the same time he
declared that it was absolutely needless. He
also declared that "Lee had drawn off his
best men at the very time when he was facing
a body of British far superior to himself
in numbers, but that even then the redcoats
could be beaten if a stand were made against
them."</p>

<p>There was no time for an extended conversation,
but, doubtless, the two officers understood
what the exceedingly vigorous language
of Mad Anthony Wayne was intended to convey,
and after receiving the suggestions he
sent by them to General Washington, and
assured now that they had discovered the
worst, they put spurs to their horses and rode
swiftly back to give the information they had
received to the great commander.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, General Washington himself
had not been idle, we may be well assured.
Riding swiftly forward, he met band after
band of the retreating, disorderly Continentals,
and heard many expressions of anger and
disgust, very like to that which had already
greeted the two officers he had sent forward.</p>

<p>At last, in the rear of the retreating column,
he met General Wayne and his angry
men. Hastily summoning Mad Anthony and
two or three of his officers, the great leader
told them that he "should depend upon them
that day to give the enemy a check," and
quickly directed General Wayne to form his
men, and, with their two pieces of artillery,
strive to stop the progress of the redcoats.</p>

<p>It was just at this moment that General
Lee himself rode up, and the scene which followed
was one which those who witnessed it
never forgot. There is no more sublime sight
in all this world than the towering passion of
a great man. Not pettiness, not irritability,
but the just and righteous anger of a noble,
large-hearted man in the presence of wickedness.</p>

<p>General Washington probably never before
in all his life had been so angry as he was
at that time. Thoughts of the cause of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
country he loved, the lives of thousands of
brave and devoted patriots, the sight of angry,
desperate men all about him, the disappointment
at the loss of what he had confidently
counted upon, the loss also of that
for which so many noble men had been sacrificing
and toiling through many weary days
and on their long marches, rushed upon him
like a flood. And before him stood the guilty
man who alone was to be blamed for it all.
Small wonder is it that Washington was
almost beside himself with rage and sorrow.</p>

<p>The name of Benedict Arnold is one that
is hated to-day by every American schoolboy,
for, after all, most boys can be trusted to
hate evil in whatever form it presents itself.
But the treachery of Benedict Arnold had at
least the merit of being unmasked and comparatively
open, for he took his stand boldly
on the side of the redcoats, whom he at one
time had fought with a bravery none can
ever forget. But the memory of Charles Lee
has not even that redeeming quality, for his
actions on the field of Monmouth can only
be explained on the ground of treachery or
cowardice, and a coward is not very greatly
to be preferred to a traitor. If both Lee and
Arnold had fallen in battle, how much better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
it would have been for them and their friends,
for "a good name is to be preferred above
great riches," and they left neither. Perhaps
the strange desire which Lee later expressed
in his will, that his "body should not be
interred in any church or churchyard, or
within a mile of any Presbyterian or Baptist
church," was not entirely out of keeping with
the man himself.</p>

<p>The conversation between Washington and
Lee at the time they met on the retreat at
Monmouth has been variously reported; but
doubtless the fact that those who heard it
were as excited as the generals themselves
may in part account for the differences in the
reports which have come down to us. We
may be sure the conversation was not extended
to the length which some have said it
was, or that it savored largely of the high-flown
expressions which have been quoted.</p>

<p>One of the men who was present is reported
to have said that Washington in his
sternest manner looked at Lee, and demanded,
"What is the meaning of all this, sir?"</p>

<p>Dismayed by the terrible appearance of
the commander-in-chief, and mortified that he
should be so addressed in the presence of his
soldiers, the crestfallen general could only
stammer, "Sir? sir?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the enraged commander demanded
the meaning of the retreat, and Lee attempted
to explain. His orders, he said, had
been misunderstood, his officers had not
obeyed his commands, he had not thought it
wise to attempt to make a stand against the
British with his detachment; but the angry
Washington would not stay to listen to the
lame attempts at explanation, and muttering
something about a "poltroon," he hastened
back to the high ground between the meeting-house
and the bridge, where he quickly formed
the regiments which were waiting there.</p>

<p>Apparently thinking better of his words,
he then rode back to General Lee and inquired
whether he still desired to retain the
command on that height or not. "If you
will," he added, "I will return to the main
body and have it formed on the next height."</p>

<p>As Lee accepted the offer, Washington
said: "I expect you will take proper means
for checking the enemy."</p>

<p>"Your orders shall be obeyed," replied
Lee, "and I shall not be the first to leave
the ground."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the British general Clinton had
also been busy. He had ordered back many
of the troops which the Hessian general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Knyphausen commanded, and was making
vigorous attempts to compel the Americans
to keep up the retreat, which Lee had ordered
with such disastrous results.</p>

<p>The forces under Mad Anthony had rallied
at the call of their leader, and were bravely
holding their position near the parsonage.
The British grenadiers climbed over the
fence which crossed the lot in front of
Wayne, but were quickly driven back by
the angry Continentals.</p>

<p>Again the determined British advanced,
and again were driven back. Then their
brave leader, Colonel Monckton, placing himself
at their head, and calling upon his men
to follow him, led the charge. But Mad
Anthony and his men were waiting for them,
and under their terrible fire the brave colonel
and many of his men went down as the grass
falls before the scythe of the mower. Desperate
was the struggle then for the body of
the fallen leader. Hand to hand, clubbing
their muskets, using their bayonets any way,
every way, the men fought on; but the band
of sturdy Americans held both the body and
the place, and as the British fell back it was
not to attack Mad Anthony's men again
during that day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Henry Clinton then moved the main
body of his troops against the left of the
Americans, where General (Lord) Stirling
was in command, but the batteries were so
well handled that there also the redcoats were
repulsed.</p>

<p>Then they turned toward the American
right; but that sturdy blacksmith from
Rhode Island, Nathanael Greene, was there,
and no better success crowned their desperate
and determined efforts. And Mad Anthony
and his men had rushed to the assistance of
their comrades. When his men perceived
the nature of the work which was expected
of them, they prepared for the action after
their own peculiar manner. As we already
know, many of them had cast aside their
coats when they entered the battle, but now
some of them stopped and deliberately rolled
up their shirt sleeves. A shout greeted the
men, when their action was perceived, and
in a moment their companions had followed
their example. Then, with cheers and calls,
the unsoldierly appearing soldiers rushed into
the fray, and so vigorous was their work that
soon the redcoats were compelled to retreat
behind the defile, where the first stand had
been made in the beginning of the battle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>There they felt secure. On either side lay
heavy swamps and thick woods, while in front
of them was a narrow pass, through which
the Americans must go if they continued the
attack.</p>

<p>And that was just what General Washington
determined to do. Carefully he arranged
for divisions to move upon the right and upon
the left, while the artillery was to be brought
up and pour its terrible fire directly into the
front of the position the British had taken.</p>

<p>The men responded with a will, but before
the detachments could gain the desired position
the night had come, and darkness spread
over the field, wrapping friend and foe alike
within its folds. Although the eager Americans
could not then advance, they resolved
to pass the night in the positions they then
held, which were very near to the lines of
the British, and renew the attack as soon as
the light of the morning came.</p>

<p>Guards were established, and then the entire
army prepared for the night. The
exhausted men threw themselves upon the
ground, many of them lying at full length
with their arms spread wide and their faces
resting directly upon the sand. Seldom have
men been more completely worn out than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
were those hardy soldiers on that day of the
battle of Monmouth. Many had fallen, and
when their friends examined their bodies for
the marks of the fatal bullets not a scratch
could be found.</p>

<p>The beams of the summer sun had accomplished
what, in many instances, the bullets
of the enemy had failed to do. All day long
the sun had hung in the heavens like a great
red ball of fire. Steadily the heat had risen
higher and higher, until it had arrived at a
point which even the "oldest inhabitants"
could not exaggerate in their stories. The
tongues of some of the men had swelled so
that speech became impossible. The poor
Hessians, condemned to wear their heavy fur
hats, left many a lifeless body behind them
which the heat had conquered before the
desperate Americans could accomplish the
same result.</p>

<p>For hours that night not a sign of life
appeared in the American camp. Motionless
as logs the exhausted soldiers lay stretched
upon the ground, and the sounds of their
deep breathing were all that could be heard.
They had not stopped even to bury their
dead, so little life did the living men apparently
retain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>Great was the astonishment in the American
camp when the first faint streaks of
the dawn appeared on the following morning,
and it was discovered that not a soldier
remained in the British camp. Sir Henry
Clinton had permitted his weary men to rest
until ten o'clock, and then, in silence, preparations
were made to join the forces of General
Knyphausen, who, meanwhile, had marched
on and gone into camp at Nut Swamp, near
the Heights of Middletown.</p>

<p>The British soldiers hastily had collected
their wounded, leaving only forty of the poor
fellows behind them, and then under the light
of the moon began their march to the position
which Knyphausen was holding. So
wearied were the American soldiers, so heavy
was their slumber, and so silent were all the
movements of Clinton's men, that their departure
was not discovered before the morning
came, and by that time the redcoats were with
the Hessians and safe from all danger of an
attack.</p>

<p>General Washington considered a further
pursuit as "impracticable and fruitless," and
greatly to the chagrin of his army no attempt
was made to push forward. The great battle
of Monmouth had been fought. The soldiers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
hastily prepared to bury their dead, and so
hurried were their movements that one man
afterwards declared he had seen the bodies of
thirteen men cast into one shallow pit which
had been dug in the sand. Yet the Continentals
were neither brutal nor indifferent.
A British army was near them, and desperate
haste was considered necessary.</p>

<p>The results of the battle, its effect upon
the redcoats and buffcoats, and those who
wore no coats at all, and the parts which Tom
Coward and certain other of our acquaintances
had taken in the struggle, we must
reserve for another chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RETURN TO BENZEOR'S HOUSE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were several motives in the mind of
Little Peter which made him eager to overtake
Ted and the fat and kicking Jeshurun,
not the least of which was the sense of protection
he felt in the presence of the powerful
man. Boyish as Ted was in many ways, his
great size and wonderful physical strength
made him a companion to be desired in the
midst of such dangers as the troubled lad
was compelled to face in those sad times in
Old Monmouth.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Little Peter ran eagerly forward,
hoping to overtake Ted before he
should arrive at Benzeor's house, which now
was not more than two miles away. Long
before he came within sight of the place, he
discovered Ted and his steed in advance of
him, and from their motionless attitude he
quickly concluded that Jeshurun had been
seized with another attack of obstinacy.</p>

<p>His surmise proved to be correct, and as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
came nearer he beheld Ted seated by the
roadside holding Jeshurun's bridle in his hand,
and apparently waiting patiently for the time
when the little beast should decide to continue
his journey.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you, lad," remarked Ted,
as Little Peter approached. "I left you
rather suddenly back there, but when Jesh
makes up his mind to start, it's time for me
to go, too, and I can't always stop to say
good-by to my friends. It's easier than
walkin', though, but I wish I knew some way
to fix the little rascal. I've been thinkin' as
how, if Jeshurun kicked when he waxed fat,
it might be that if he waxed thin, the kickin'
would go, too, along with the fatness. I say,
Little Peter, I want to ask ye a question."</p>

<p>"All right, Ted, go ahead," replied Little
Peter, as he fanned his dripping face with his
hat and took a seat beside his companion.</p>

<p>"In your opinion," said Ted soberly, "is
the oyster a wild animal, or a tame one?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Is the oyster a wild animal or a tame
one? Maybe you don't think he's an animal
at all, only just an insect; but my opinion is
that he's an animal, and what I'd like to
know is whether he's wild or tame."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>"He isn't savage, anyway," remarked
Little Peter demurely.</p>

<p>"I'm not talkin' about whether he's savage
or not, but whether he's wild or tame.
That's been a-botherin' me a good bit, and I
just can't find any answer. Whoa! Whoa
there, Jesh! What's the matter with ye?
If ye want to start on, I'm your man."
These last remarks were directed at the mule,
which had begun to display some of the
qualities of the famous character for whom
he had been named; but his owner's words
served to calm him, and Jeshurun soon stood
in such an abject attitude that, to one who
was not familiar with his ways, wickedness
and kicking would never have been suspected
of him.</p>

<p>"Maybe the oyster's a bird more than he
is an insect," said Little Peter. "When his
shell is spread out it looks something like
wings."</p>

<p>"No, he isn't a bird, he's a animal," said
Ted, "and what I want to know is whether
he's a tame or a wild one."</p>

<p>"What do you want to know for?"</p>

<p>"Why, the way of it is this: Some time
ago I planted an oyster-bed off the mouth of
the river, and the first thing I knew my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
neighbors was a-helpin' themselves to it.
When I said I didn't like that very much,
and those oysters was mine, all the men did
was to laugh. Yes, sir, jest laughed," repeated
Ted, as if he felt aggrieved at the
levity of his neighbors. "Then, they went
on to tell me that I couldn't plant oysters,
same as I did 'taties and things in my garden.
Oysters was wild things and belonged to anybody
that found them, jest the same as turtles
and clams and wild geese did. I've been
a-puzzlin' my head a good deal over it, and I
can't make it out. I planted them oysters
for Sallie,&mdash;she's my wife, ye know,&mdash;and
as long as she had all she wanted of 'em, I
didn't care how much the neighbors helped
themselves; but when it comes to sayin' that
them oysters I planted don't belong to me,
but any one can go and take all he wants,
jest as if they was clams, or gooseberries, or&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;saltwater,
I don't know what
to do about it. What do you think, Little
Peter?" he added anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I never thought of it
before."</p>

<p>Absurd as the question appears to us, it
was far from being so to the people of Old
Monmouth in the times of which we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
writing. So warm had the discussion become
that it was soon after carried into the
courts, and in 1808 a case was tried before
the supreme court, but no definite decision
was gained. In 1821 another famous trial
was held, and finally in 1858 the supreme
court decided that oysters were both tame
and wild. Where they had grown naturally
and without being planted, they were to be
considered as wild and the property of any
one who chose to take them; but where they
had been planted, and there was no natural
growth, the oysters were "tame" and the
property of the one who had made the bed.
Even after that decision there was trouble for
a long time in Old Monmouth over the question,
although to-day it is generally accepted
that a man may own oysters as he does other
animals.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry ye can't help me," said Ted.</p>

<p>"So am I, but I'm not thinking of oysters
just now. I want to go up to Benzeor
Osburn's more than anything else."</p>

<p>"I'm with ye. We're so near, maybe
Jeshurun will be willing to go, if he doesn't
have to carry me on his back. I'll try him
and see."</p>

<p>To the surprise of both, Jeshurun appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
to be willing to resume the journey and obediently
followed Ted, who led him by the bridle
rein which he slipped over the mule's head.</p>

<p>In this wise they all walked on, but as they
came nearer to the end of their journey, conversation
ceased. Little Peter was thinking
of the children and trying to devise some
plan by which he might care for them. What
his companion's thoughts were did not appear,
but the expression upon his face had
undergone a change, and from the occasional
word he dropped, which sounded very like
"Hangin' Sallies," the lad thought he knew
what was going on in Ted's mind. What
would occur if Benzeor should be found at
his home, Little Peter could not determine;
but he felt assured from Ted's manner that
this time his neighbor would not escape so
easily as he had when the angry man had
given him his involuntary bath in the waters
of the Shrewsbury River.</p>

<p>However, there was a deal of comfort for
the lad in the company of his powerful friend;
and as Benzeor's little house now appeared in
the distance, he was more and more rejoiced
that he was not compelled to approach it alone.
If Indian John's words were correct, Benzeor
was not there now; but it was more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
possible that John had been mistaken, or that
the man had returned since his visit in the
early morning.</p>

<p>These possibilities were sufficiently strong
to increase Little Peter's excitement, and
when they turned into the lane which led up
to the house his heart was beating rapidly
and his breathing was hard and fast. As he
glanced toward the place, he suddenly discovered
some children playing in the yard
and instantly recognized two of them as his
own little brothers.</p>

<p>The children, then, were safe; and with a
sigh of relief he turned to his companion and
said, "There are my little brothers! They're
all right, and so far it looks better."</p>

<p>"Hangin' Sallies!" muttered Ted; and
Little Peter said no more, as he perceived that
his companion's rage over the treatment his
wife had received had returned with increased
force.</p>

<p>Suddenly out from the barn beyond the
house started two men on horseback, riding
directly down the lane toward them. Startled
and perplexed by the sight, both Little Peter
and Ted stopped and waited for the men to
approach. If the lad had been alone he
would instantly have turned and fled without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
waiting to see who the strangers were; but
Ted's presence restrained him, and although
he was thoroughly alarmed, he waited with
his companion.</p>

<p>As the horsemen came nearer he discovered
that they were Barzilla Giberson and Jacob
Vannote, the two men who had been with
Tom and Benzeor on their voyage to New
York just before Tom's departure from his
foster-father's home. Quickly recalling what
Tom had reported of their conversation at
that time, the sight of them now did not
tend to allay his fears; but Ted's presence
was a source of comfort, and, although he
was trembling in his excitement, he did not
speak.</p>

<p>Barzilla instantly stopped his horse as he
recognized Little Peter, and, leaning forward
on his horse's neck as he spoke, said,
"Where's Benzeor?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Little Peter.
"Isn't he here?"</p>

<p>"No, he isn't here. He came back last
night, but he's gone again, and the women
folks pretend they don't know where he is.
It's lucky for him."</p>

<p>"What do you want of him?"</p>

<p>"You and he both will know more about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
that after we've found him," replied Barzilla,
as he touched his horse with his spurs, and
both men rode swiftly down the lane and
soon disappeared from sight up the road.</p>

<p>Little Peter told his companion of his suspicions
as they resumed their walk, and Ted
quickly stopped, and, shaking his fist in the
direction in which the horsemen had disappeared,
said, "Hangin' Sallies! Maybe I'd
better take after them, if I don't find Benzeor."</p>

<p>"No, no, Ted. Come on, we're almost
here now."</p>

<p>They soon entered the yard, and as the
children discovered the presence of their
brother they ran eagerly to him and threw
themselves into his arms.</p>

<p>"I want to go home. I want to go home.
May we go home now?" said one of them.</p>

<p>Little Peter's eyes filled with tears as he
lifted the child in his arms and said, "No, I'm
afraid not. We haven't any home now."</p>

<p>"But I want to go home," persisted the
little fellow pleadingly. "I don't want to
stay here any longer. I want to go home."</p>

<p>"Hasn't Benzeor been good to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he isn't here. I want to go
home. I want to go home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Peter glanced up and saw that Ted's
face was moving strangely, and that the tears
were streaming from his eyes. The powerful
man had a heart as tender as a woman's, and
the piteous pleadings of the homeless, motherless
little lad were more than he could endure.</p>

<p>"Here, Little Peter!" said Ted hastily.
"You go in the house, and I'll look after
the babies while you're gone. Here, my
lads and lassies all! Come take a ride on
the back of Jeshurun."</p>

<p>In a moment the grief of the little ones
was forgotten, and, laughing in their delight,
they were lifted upon the back of Jeshurun,
who to all appearances had suddenly become
as mild and gentle as a lamb.</p>

<p>Little Peter glanced back at the laughing
group as he started toward the house, and
then looking up beheld Sarah standing in the
doorway. Her face was red with weeping
and she evidently was in great distress.</p>

<p>"Why, Sarah!" exclaimed Little Peter.
"What's the trouble? What is it?"</p>

<p>"My father! My father!" sobbed Sarah,
burying her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"What's happened to him? Is he killed?
Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"No, no. It's worse than that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>"Worse than that? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Little Peter, don't <i>you</i> know?" exclaimed
the girl, looking up again as she
spoke.</p>

<p>Peter made no reply. He did not know
just what it was to which Sarah referred, and
although he had his own suspicions, he did
not feel that he could refer to them in the
presence of the troubled girl.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Tom?" said Sarah suddenly.</p>

<p>"No. He's in the army, I think, and I
haven't been near that."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have to go very far. They
say they're both near here, and that there
either has been a battle or there will be one
soon. I wish Tom was here. If you see
him, won't you tell him to come back just as
soon as he can?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if I see him. I don't know that I
shall very soon, though. I don't know what
to do, Sarah. I came to see about the children."</p>

<p>"They're all right. They seem to be
now, don't they?" she said, as a burst of
laughter came from the noisy group. "Perhaps
you don't want to leave them here now,
though," she added, her eyes filling with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
tears once more as she spoke. "I wish you
would leave them. It isn't much we can do
for you, but we want to do what we can."</p>

<p>There was an intensity in Sarah's manner
which Little Peter could not understand.
He was in ignorance of all that Sarah knew,
and perhaps if he had known his reply might
have been somewhat different.</p>

<p>"It's good of you, Sarah. I don't know
what to do or where to go."</p>

<p>"You can stay here, too."</p>

<p>"No, no. I can't do that," he said hastily;
and then fearing that he had said too much,
added, "I'll leave the children for a little
while. They'll be safe here till after the
battle you tell about."</p>

<p>"I wish you would, Peter. You couldn't
please us better. Who's that man with
you?" she added, apparently for the first
time becoming aware of Ted's presence.</p>

<p>"A man to see your father," said Little
Peter evasively. "Is he home?"</p>

<p>"No, no," and Sarah shuddered as she
spoke. "He came last night, but he didn't
stay long. He went away again, and I don't
know when he'll come again. It'll be a
long time. I hope"&mdash;</p>

<p>What Sarah hoped for she did not explain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
and Little Peter said, "I want to talk with
Ted before I say anything more. He's the
man out there with the children. I'll be
back in a minute."</p>

<p>Many minutes passed, however, before the
lad returned. He called to Ted and for a
long time they talked together. Ted was
decidedly averse to the plan of leaving the
children in Benzeor's home, and freely offered
to take them with him to the place where he
had left Sallie and his own little ones, also
venturing to refer several times to the fact
that Sallie was his wife.</p>

<p>Pleased as Little Peter would have been to
accept the offer, Sarah's pleadings could not
be forgotten, and as he felt that the children
would be safe where they then were, he
declined the kind offer of Ted.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, my lad," said Ted at
last. "If the armies are as near here as the
girl says they are, the thing for you and me
to do is to go over there. They may need
us, too. The most I've done so far has
been to look out for that stuff the men
brought up the Shrewsbury in the supply
boat. That's all in good hands now, and I'm
free to go. Jesh will be glad to go, too."</p>

<p>"But you can't leave Sallie and the babies."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I can, too. Sallie's my wife, ye
know, and when I took her over to the
Dennises I told her I might not be back for
a week or two. She won't be disappointed,
and Jesh will be tickled to pieces to join the
army. Jest look at his ears now. When his
ears is that way, I always know Jeshurun
wants to fight the Dutch butchers."</p>

<p>"We've no other place to go to, or at
least I haven't," said Little Peter thoughtfully.
"Well, we'll do as you say. I'll go
and tell Sarah."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you'll leave the children,"
said Sarah eagerly, when Little Peter reported
the decision which had been made.
"It isn't much we can do, as I told you, but
we do want to do everything we can for you."</p>

<p>"It's good of you to take them."</p>

<p>"It's good of you to leave them. There's
one thing, though, I must tell you. We
haven't much to eat in the house. There's
some meal over at the mill, and father would
have gone for it if he'd been home to-day.
But he isn't here and I don't know what
we'll do."</p>

<p>"You'd like to have me go over there and
get it, before we start," said the boy. "Have
you got your horses yet?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, there are two in the barn, and you
can take the heavy wagon. It's kind of
you to do it, Little Peter, but it won't take
you long, and you don't know how much it
will help us just now."</p>

<p>"I'll go right away."</p>

<p>Little Peter turned and explained to Ted
the cause of the delay. At first, Ted insisted
upon going with him, but as the lad explained
that only two hours would be required for
the journey, he persuaded him to remain.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the two horses had been
led forth from the barn, and hitched to the
wagon ("geared" was what Ted called the
task), and then Little Peter mounted the seat,
grasped the reins in his hands, and turned
down the lane, on what proved to be the most
eventful ride in all his life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RIDE TO THE MILL</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> early morning had not yet gone when
Little Peter started on his journey to the
mill. He knew the place well, for many a
time had he gone there for his father. It
was an antiquated structure beside a pond,
which had been formed by a dam built across
the very brook near which he and Indian
John had passed the preceding night.</p>

<p>The work at the mill had been somewhat
interrupted since the outbreak of the war,
but the increasing necessities of the people of
Old Monmouth had led the miller to resume
his labors, and Sarah had informed Little
Peter that he would surely find him in his
accustomed place.</p>

<p>At times, the road led through the woods,
and the boy could almost touch the bushes
that grew close to the sandy roadway on
either side. His view was somewhat obstructed
by these,&mdash;and that fact, together
with the unbroken stillness that rested over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
all, combined to make Little Peter watchful,
and somewhat fearful as well.</p>

<p>The sunlight flickered through the treetops
and cast fantastic shadows on the ground.
The horses did not increase their speed above
a slow trot, for the heat was oppressive and
the sandy road was heavy; and, eager as
Little Peter was to be back again at Benzeor's
house, he had not the heart to urge
on the toiling beasts. The mill was not
more than three miles from the place from
which he had started, and at the pace at
which the horses were then going the lad
thought he would be back in less than two
hours.</p>

<p>He had covered about half of the way to
the mill when his horses, with a sudden snort
of fear, darted to one side of the roadway.
Little Peter quickly drew the reins tight, and
stood up to discover the cause of the alarm.</p>

<p>Two men stepped from the bushes into the
road, and as they grasped the horses by their
bits the lad at once recognized them as Barzilla
Giberson and Jacob Vannote.</p>

<p>"We thought you were Benzeor," exclaimed
Barzilla, as he discovered who the
driver was.</p>

<p>"I've got his horses," replied Little Peter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>"So I see. What are you doing with
them?"</p>

<p>"Going to the mill. You know the children
are at Benzeor's house, and Sarah
wanted me to go for some meal. She said
there was none in the house and her father
wasn't likely to be home in time to get it, so
I came for it."</p>

<p>"Where's your father?"</p>

<p>"He's been sent to New York."</p>

<p>"So I've heard. Little Peter, do you
know who made the attack on your house?"</p>

<p>"It was Fenton's gang, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"So am I, and I ought to know, for I was
there myself."</p>

<p>"You there?" exclaimed Little Peter.
He did not refer to the suspicions he had
entertained concerning the very men who
then stood before him; but he had never expected
them to declare their actions so boldly.
The alarm which he had felt, when the two
men had suddenly presented themselves in
the road, was greatly increased now, and for
a moment he glanced quickly about as if he
were seeking some avenue of escape.</p>

<p>"Yes, we were there," resumed Barzilla,
apparently ignoring the lad's alarm. "I
didn't know but you knew it, and I've felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
mean enough about it, too. We didn't have
anything to do with what happened there,"
he hastily added; "but the truth is, we
thought it was about time some kind of a
stop was put to the doings of the pine robbers,&mdash;so
Jacob, here, and I pretended to go
in with them. Of course we didn't like the
work, but we hoped we could learn enough
about their plans to trap them. And we've
almost succeeded. We've been as busy as
you have, my lad, and pretty soon we hope
the murderers of your mother will be run to
cover."</p>

<p>Little Peter had never thought of the
scheme which Barzilla mentioned, and at first
he did not know whether to believe him or
not. Certainly appearances were against him,
but he was in no position to dispute the
statement.</p>

<p>"Is that what Benzeor was doing, too?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"Benzeor? Benzeor Osburn? Don't you
know what he had to do"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold on, Barzilla," interrupted Jacob.
"Little Peter doesn't know about him, or he
wouldn't let the children stay there."</p>

<p>"Why? What do you mean? Aren't
the children safe there?" said Peter quickly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>"Safe? They couldn't be safer if they
were in China, or some other heathing land,"
said Barzilla. "Even Benzeor's horses are
safe. There isn't such a team as that left in
Old Monmouth," he added, "and if his beasts
aren't touched, I don't think you need to
worry very much about the young ones."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said Little Peter.</p>

<p>"You don't need to," said Jacob quickly,
"You've got enough to worry about, my
boy, without bothering your head over Barzilla's
words. He talks too much, anyway.
You just go on and get the meal for Sarah;
that's all you need to think about now."</p>

<p>"Yes, but Little Peter ought to know a bit
more," said Barzilla doggedly. "The truth
is that we've run some of Fenton's gang into
these very woods. There are several of us
scouring the region, and it's only fair to tell
you that you may run across some of 'em if
you keep on. For my part I advise you to
turn back and not go to the mill at all. It
isn't safe."</p>

<p>"Nobody'll touch him. Let him go on,"
said Jacob. "The children will have to be
fed, and he might as well get the meal. He's
safe enough."</p>

<p>"He can do as he pleases," muttered Barzilla.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Peter was perplexed, for the actions
and words of the men were sadly confusing.
Tom had reported to him some of their previous
conversations, and his own suspicions,
as we know, had been aroused. If Barzilla
spoke truly now, he was in no slight danger
himself, while the very decided difference of
opinion between the two men tended to increase
his confusion.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to tell you some more," said
Jacob. "Last night some of Fenton's gang
went over to Mr. Farr's. You know the old
man, don't you?"</p>

<p>"You mean Thomas Farr, the old man
who lives with his wife and daughter over on
the road to Imlaystown?"</p>

<p>"That's the very man. Well, Lew Fenton
and some of his gang went over there
about midnight, and attacked the house.
There wasn't any one in it but the old man
and his wife and their daughter, and you
know she's old enough to have arrived at
years of discretion, to put it mildly. The
old people barricaded the doors with logs of
wood just as soon as they discovered who the
men were.</p>

<p>"The pine robbers tried to break the door
down with some fence rails, but when that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
failed, they fired a volley of bullets right
through the door. One ball broke the leg
of the old man, but still they wouldn't let
the pine robbers in. Then the villains went
around to the back door and succeeded in
smashing that in. They stuck a bayonet into
the old man, who was helpless on the floor,
and then they murdered his wife right before
his eyes. One of the men struck the daughter
with the butt of his gun, but, although
she was pretty badly hurt, she managed to
get out of the house.</p>

<p>"Fenton's gang didn't wait to plunder the
place, but, as they were afraid she'd raise an
alarm, they all cleared out. 'Twas mighty
lucky for them that they did, for there was a
lot of us near by. You see we'd seen Benzeor"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold on, Jacob. That's enough. Now,
Peter, you see what's going on, and it's my
opinion that some of Fenton's gang, and
maybe Fenton himself, are in these very
woods. That's why I advised ye not to go
on. Now you can do jest as ye like, for
you've got pretty much the whole story."</p>

<p>"I think you'll be all right," said Jacob.
"It's only a little way up to the mill, and
the children need that meal. I should go if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
I was in your place, and if I didn't have to
keep watch here, I'd go with ye myself."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Little Peter quietly.</p>

<p>"Good luck to ye, then," said Barzilla.
"We'll see you here when you come back."</p>

<p>Little Peter picked up the reins and at
once started, leaving the two men behind
him, who remained standing in the road, and
watched him until he disappeared from sight.
The lad's feelings, however, had undergone
a very decided change. He was convinced
that the story concerning the aged Thomas
Farr was true, and he was also persuaded
that his suspicions of Jacob and Barzilla
were unjust.</p>

<p>Every tree now might be the hiding-place
of Fenton, or some of his band. Each moment
he expected to see some one step forth
into the road before him and stop his horses.
The very silence in the woods served to increase
his alarm. He quickened the speed of
the horses, and soon they were wet with foam,
as they toiled on through the heavy sand.
The cry of a bird, or the chattering of a
squirrel, caused the excited lad to glance fearfully
in the direction from which the sound
came. To his excited imagination the woods
were filled with his enemies, and more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
once a fallen tree or a broken branch took
on the outlines of a man.</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of intense relief that
at last he saw the crumbling old mill before
him. The sound of the water, as it dropped
from the dam to the bed of the brook below,
was like music in his ears; and when he discovered
the miller himself standing in the
doorway, he again increased the speed of his
horses, and soon halted before the mill.</p>

<p>"I've come for Benzeor Osburn's grist,"
he said, as he leaped from his seat to the
ground.</p>

<p>"They must be pretty hungry over there,
from the looks of your horses."</p>

<p>"They are. Has any one been here this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul. There's no work now, with
all this fighting going on. Have you heard
anything from the soldiers?"</p>

<p>"Not much, only that both the armies
must be near here now."</p>

<p>There was nothing, however, in the presence
of the old mill to indicate that war's
rude alarms were to be heard anywhere in the
region. The monotonous sound of the falling
water, the dull hum of the big wheel, the
little garden which the miller had planted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
near his log house close by, the dog lying
asleep on the doorsill, the little urchins playing
in the waters of the brook, the hens fluttering
in the roadway and covering themselves
with dust,&mdash;all seemed to declare that
only peace and quiet were to be found in the
region.</p>

<p>And yet, only a few miles away two great
armies had assembled, and, on the morrow
the summer air would resound with the booming
of cannon, and many a buffcoat and redcoat
would be left lying side by side upon
the plains of Old Monmouth, never again to
be mindful of the struggle, or hear or heed
the calls of their officers as they led the men
into battle.</p>

<p>At that very time, if the words of Barzilla
Giberson were true, the woods, which extended
between the mill and the main road,
concealed some of the hated pine robbers, as
well as outraged patriots who were searching
for their enemies.</p>

<p>The wagon was soon loaded, the miller's
share of the grist having first been set aside,
and Little Peter climbed up on the seat and
grasped the reins, as he prepared to start
again.</p>

<p>"You'd better be careful," said Little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
Peter. "I'm told some of the pine robbers
are hiding in these woods."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," laughed the miller.
"I never harmed them and they won't harm
me."</p>

<p>The lad related the story of the attack
upon the house of Thomas Farr, but still the
miller to all appearances was not deeply impressed.</p>

<p>"I haven't any money and they've nothing
to gain by disturbing me. I grind
my grists just the same, whether it's a king
or Congress that rules over me, and I don't
care much, for my part, which it is. I don't
bother my head about such things. All I
want is good water and plenty of corn, and
I'm happy all the day long."</p>

<p>Little Peter had given his warning, so he
said no more, but bidding the miller good-day,
he spoke to his horses and at once
departed.</p>

<p>His load was heavier now than when he
had come, and consequently he was compelled
to let his horses walk. Even then the sweltering
beasts labored heavily under the intense
heat, and he was compelled to stop
frequently and permit them to rest in some
cool and shady spot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>His own fears had not departed, however,
but every turn of the heavy wheels brought
him nearer to the main road, and once there
he thought he would be safe. Already one
of the three miles had been left behind him,
and he was about to start on, after the brief
rest he had given the horses, when he was
startled by the sound of something breaking
through the bushes that lined the road in
front of him.</p>

<p>Tremblingly he waited a moment, gazing
with frightened face at the place in the road
where the man, or animal, or whatever it
was, would first appear. His suspense was
not relieved when a horse and rider broke
through the bushes and stopped only a few
yards in advance of him.</p>

<p>Little Peter's face was deadly pale when he
instantly recognized the man as none other
than Lewis Fenton himself. He noted the
great size, the broad shoulders, the powerful
arms, for the pine robber was riding without
a coat, and his shirt-sleeves were rolled back,
disclosing the great bunches of muscles; but
more than all else the brutal face terrified him.</p>

<p>Before he could speak or move, Fenton
leaped to the ground, and leaving his horse
by the roadside approached the wagon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>"How now, young man? Give an account
of yourself. Where you going? Who
are you? As I live, if it isn't Little Peter
Van Mater!" he added in evident astonishment.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he grasped the frightened
lad by the shoulder and dragged him to
the ground. Then the brutal, cowardly man
struck him two savage blows. The sight of
the woods and even of the pine robber faded
from Little Peter's eyes, and the unconscious
boy dropped heavily upon the sand. Even
then Fenton was not satisfied, for again and
again he kicked the body, apparently not yet
convinced that life was extinct.</p>

<p>But Little Peter suffered no pain. With
sightless eyes, his blood-stained face looked
up at the blue sky above the treetops, but
neither the passing clouds nor the further
actions of the brutal pine robber were heeded
by the lad.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AFTER THE BATTLE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Tom Coward</span>, as we know, had been selected
to serve as one of the guides of the
American army. The roads were not so
numerous as to cause any fear of serious trouble
from confusion; but boys and young men
from the region were nevertheless assigned
to this duty, and in some instances were said
to have been so greatly excited as to have
failed in finding the way themselves. To
this cause some assigned the failure of Morgan's
dragoons to enter the battle; but doubtless
there were other causes as well which
prevented that terrible band of riflemen from
having a share in the struggle.</p>

<p>Tom had been reserved to move with the
troops that were under the command of General
Washington himself, and that followed
the division which General Lee had failed to
lead into battle. Frightened as the lad was,
he still noted keenly all that was occurring
about him, and had been as highly excited as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
any over the interview which took place between
Washington and Lee when the latter
was retreating. The impressions he there
received were those which the people of Old
Monmouth ever after retained concerning
Charles Lee, for he was remembered, not for
his experiences abroad or for his successes in
the south, but as the man who had been the
traitor in the battle.</p>

<p>When the engagement began, Tom's duties
as guide were ended, but as no one gave him
any instructions, he was driven from one
band of men to another, and while he still
retained the rifle which he had taken when
he had departed from Benzeor's house, he
had not made any use of it.</p>

<p>For a time he remained within sight of
the young lieutenant, and they were together
when in the early part of the battle Captain
Molly had done the deed which has caused
her name to be remembered until this day.
Molly had marched with her husband, and as
the advanced batteries opened fire upon each
other the intrepid woman had been running
back and forth between the men and a little
spring, which was near by, bringing water to
her husband and his companions. Her task
was no light one in the heat of that day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>As she had started to return from one
of her visits to the spring, she turned just
in time to see her husband fall as he was
advancing to his post, for he was a cannoneer,
as we already know. Molly hastily ran to
his assistance, but she at once perceived that
he was dead. She heard an officer order the
cannon to be moved from its position, but
instantly controlling her grief, she declared
her purpose to take her husband's place.
Amidst the cheers of the men she did so, and
so bravely and well did she perform the
duty, that after the battle was ended General
Greene himself presented her to the great
commander and related the story of her
bravery. Washington added his words of
praise and bestowed upon her a lieutenant's
commission. The men received the news
with loud cheers, and then themselves bestowed
upon "Molly Pitcher" the title of
"Captain Molly," and as Captain Molly she
was known thereafter.</p>

<p>Another story, told afterwards by the
Frenchmen, reflected great credit upon General
Clinton, and perhaps in a measure atoned
for the action of that commander in wantonly
burning so many of the houses in Old Monmouth.
An American officer with about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
twenty of his men advanced under the English
batteries to observe their position. The
redcoats opened fire, and the officer's aid-de-camp
fell at his side. The men, who were
dragoons, instantly turned and fled,&mdash;that
is, all save the officer, who, although he was
directly under the fire of the cannon, calmly
dismounted and advanced to discover whether
the fallen man was dead or not, or whether
the wound had been mortal. Quickly discovering
that the man was dead, the American
officer, visibly weeping, turned and remounted
his horse and slowly rejoined his
comrades. The officer was the young Marquis
de Lafayette, and his white charger had
been recognized by General Clinton, who
himself ordered his men not to fire, and
doubtless thereby saved the life of the brave
young nobleman. It was long cherished as
the one deed of mercy in the midst of a campaign
and battle which left its marks of
suffering and sorrow on every side.</p>

<p>An instance of the other side of the British
commander's character came to Tom's
attention not long afterwards, when he heard
of the misfortune of an old lady seventy
years of age, in whose house General Clinton
made his headquarters. The British officer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
noticing that his hostess had caused all of
her better furniture and valuables to be removed,
informed her that she need have had
no fears for the safety of her possessions,
for he himself would protect her and them,
and urged her to have them brought back
again. As the old lady expressed her fears
and objected, he repeated his assurances so
strongly that she yielded and sent a man
with a wagon to the place in which they had
been concealed.</p>

<p>When the wagon-load arrived in front of
her door, she in person applied to the British
commander for a guard; but the permission
was refused and, not even giving her a change
of dress for herself or her aged husband, the
goods were at once confiscated, and the old
lady was compelled to give up her bedroom
and sleep with the negro women upon the
floor of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Among the congregation which had assembled
at the "new church" to watch the
battle was one man who, instead of joining
his friends upon the roof or steeple, took his
seat upon one of the gravestones. Not long
afterwards, a cannon-ball came speeding in
that direction, and struck the unfortunate
man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>The congregation upon the roof did not
wait for the customary benediction to be pronounced,
we may be sure, and while the most
of them hastily dispersed, a few remained to
carry the wounded man into the "meeting-house,"
where he died within a few minutes,
and the stains of his blood remained for
many years upon the floor. It was within
six feet of the west end of this same "new
church" that the body of the unfortunate
British Colonel Monckton, over which the
contending forces had such a desperate struggle,
was buried.</p>

<p>Within the vicinity of Monmouth Court
House many houses and farm buildings were
set on fire and burned by the redcoats, some
of whom openly declared that there was no
hope of conquering the rebels until "they
had burned every house and killed every
man, woman, and child." Just how they
expected to conquer <i>after</i> they had burned
the buildings and slain the people is not
clear to us to-day; but doubtless the expression
and the purpose alike were born of the
fury of the battle, and was only one among
many of the results of war, which even in
its mildest forms appeals to all that is bad
in men. And as the campaign in Old Monmouth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
presented none of the milder forms of
war, such deeds, terrible as they were, were
not unnatural.</p>

<p>Nor were they all confined to one side, for
the men in buff and blue were as much
aroused as the men in scarlet, and, while
naturally the anecdotes and incidents of the
battle are largely those of the cruel deeds of
the redcoats, doubtless if all things had been
recorded, we should have found that many of
those brave ancestors of ours were not entirely
guiltless of similar deeds.</p>

<p>An unusual story was that of Captain Cook
of the Virginia Corps, who was shot through
the lungs. He was carried into a room in a
near-by house and ordered by the surgeon not
to speak. A brother officer came into the
room and tenderly asked of the wounded man
whether anything could be done for him.
Captain Cook, in spite of his sufferings, was
mindful of the surgeon's words and made no
reply. Mistaking the cause of the silence,
his friend departed from the house and reported
to Washington that Captain Cook was
dead, and then the commander ordered a
coffin to be placed under the window of the
room in which the brave captain was supposed
to be lying dead. But Captain Cook was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
not dead, nor did he die until many years
afterwards, and lived to visit several times the
good people in Old Monmouth, who had tenderly
ministered to his wants until he was
able to rejoin the army.</p>

<p>After the battle, many of the dead were
found beneath the shade of trees, or beside
the little streams to which they had crawled
for shelter or for water; and many of these
had perished, not from wounds, but from
their labors in the intense heat of the day.
Several houses at Monmouth Court House
were filled with the wounded after the battle,
and every room in the Court House itself was
likewise filled. The suffering soldiers lay
upon the straw which had been scattered over
the floors, and the groans and cries of the
wounded and the moanings of the dying resounded
together. The faces of many were
so blackened that their dearest friends did
not recognize them, and as fast as they died
their bodies were taken and buried in pits,
which were only slightly covered by the sand.</p>

<p>A similar service was rendered for the
enemy's dead, and among them was found a
sergeant of dragoons whose immense body
had been a familiar sight to both armies, for
the man was said to have been the tallest soldier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
ever seen in all the struggle of the Revolution,
and to have measured seven feet and
four inches in height.</p>

<p>So, side by side, or in neighboring graves,
the nameless bodies of friends and foes were
left for their last long sleep. The roar of
the cannon, the shouts of the men, the calls
of the officers, the bitter feelings of the awful
war were never to disturb or arouse them
again. They had done their part, and done
it well; but the land for which they struggled
could never mark their resting-places,
nor perhaps recall the names of all. But the
heroes whose names we praise would never
have been honored except for the part the
faithful and brave, but nameless and forgotten,
heroes took. In honoring the one class,
let us never forget to pay a tribute of honor
and of praise to the unknown and forgotten
heroes of Old Monmouth.</p>

<p>The loss of the Americans in the battle
had been three hundred and sixty-two. That
of the British, while it was reported to have
been four hundred and sixteen, was doubtless
much greater, for the Americans buried no
less than two hundred and forty-five of the
redcoats, and had no means of knowing how
many had been carried away. Washington<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
himself believed the loss to have been as
great as twelve hundred.</p>

<p>Who were the victors on the plains of Old
Monmouth? What were the effects of the
campaign upon the fortunes of the struggling
States? Most American writers have claimed
that the victory belonged to the Continentals
because they had driven the British from the
field, while many British writers have claimed
that it was a drawn battle.</p>

<p>Certainly, Washington must have felt bitterly
disappointed, for he had hoped to defeat
the enemy and capture their baggage and
stores. His failure to do so was not due to
the British, but to the treachery of Charles
Lee. Had Lee carried out the orders given
him, there can be little doubt to-day that the
battle of Monmouth would have aided in
putting an end to the war long before peace
came.</p>

<p>We are not concerned by what might have
been the result, however, but by what was
the result. Clinton succeeded in withdrawing
his troops and saving his baggage train,
and with both soon after embarked (June
30) upon the ships which Lord Howe had
been keeping in waiting off Sandy Hook,
and thereby gained the safety of New York.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
But his men were greatly disheartened, and
came to regard the despised "rebels" in an
entirely new light. Indeed, within a week
more than two thousand deserted, the most
of whom were Hessians, and the confidence of
those who remained was sadly broken. While
it is a current saying that "nothing succeeds
like success," it is also evident that nothing
fails like failure, and this was as true in
those trying days of the Revolution as it is
to-day, and General Clinton soon found it to
be so.</p>

<p>Upon the Americans, the moral effect of
the campaign and battle was more needed
than the material effect. Valley Forge was
passed now, Philadelphia had been abandoned
by the British, and the Americans had found
upon the plains of Old Monmouth, as they
had at Trenton and Princeton, that their
men were not inferior to their enemies, while
their officers were among the best the world
had known. The opponents and enemies of
Washington, and they were many at the time
both within and without Congress, were compelled
to be silent, and the great commander
was free to face his difficulties and dangers,
which were not ended after the battle of
Monmouth. That campaign had served<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
chiefly to place behind him one more of his
problems, but, as we shall see, many yet
remained to try the soul of the noblest American
of them all.</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile, what had become of the lad
Tom Coward? Alarmed by the battle, not
daring to fight and yet not knowing where
to withdraw, although his fear had not been
strong enough to lead to such a result, he
was driven about by the movements of the
men, and in one of the lulls which came in
the conflict, he found himself almost alone.
He was near a barn which stood beyond the
borders of the battlefield, and was just about
to turn the corner when he stumbled over
the body of a fallen man.</p>

<p>As he glanced down, he was almost overcome
when he discovered that the soldier was
his friend, the young lieutenant. A hurried
examination revealed that he was still living,
though he was badly wounded in the throat.
The lad lifted the head of the suffering man,
but a groan caused him to desist. Almost
overcome by grief and fear, he turned to seek
for aid.</p>



<p>As he looked quickly about him, he perceived
a man in the distance on the border
of the woods away from the battle-ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
Instantly he turned and ran toward him, and
to his surprise discovered that the man was
none other than Friend Nathan Brown.</p>

<p>"Come, Nathan! come! Be quick! Lieutenant
Gordon's over here by the barn.
He's terribly wounded and may die any
moment. Come and help me with him!"</p>

<p>The Quaker instantly responded, and without
explaining how it had happened that he
should be discovered so near a scene to
which in spirit as well as in practice he was
strongly opposed, ran by the side of the
eager lad to the place where the wounded
man had fallen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TOM COWARD'S PATIENT</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> place where young Lieutenant Gordon
was lying was in the rear of the barn which
belonged to the parsonage of the "new
church." After the bullet had hit him, he
had managed to crawl to that secluded place,
but the sounds of the battle, which was still
being waged in the vicinity, were not long
heard by the wounded officer, for he had
soon become unconscious, and the roar of the
cannon and the shouts of the men were all
unheeded and unheard.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" said Nathan in a low
voice, as he looked down upon the unconscious
man.</p>

<p>"No! no!" replied Tom hastily; "or at
least he wasn't a minute ago. No, he's still
alive," he added after a hurried examination.
"We must carry him away from this place."</p>

<p>"I see no place for thy friend. These
sons of Belial are not likely to permit thee to
depart unnoticed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>Friend Nathan was trembling, and his face
betrayed his alarm. And there was much to
frighten him. Clouds of smoke could be
seen not far away, and the loud shouts of
men and the reports of their guns could be
distinctly heard. The struggle near the
meeting-house was one of the most severe
in all the battle, and the danger of which
the frightened Nathan spoke was not unreal.
But Tom's fears had departed now, and
although he never fully understood the cause
of the change in his feelings, the sight of his
suffering friend and his determination to aid
him had banished all thoughts concerning
his own personal safety.</p>

<p>At a distance of a half mile, Tom could
see a little farmhouse, and he hastily decided
that the young lieutenant must be carried
there. The building was on the border of
the plain and on the side opposite to the
place where the struggle was going on.</p>

<p>There would be danger in the attempt to
carry him across the field, but thinking only
of his friend, Tom said hastily, "We must
carry him to that farmhouse yonder, Nathan.
I don't know who lives there, but whoever
does won't refuse to receive a wounded man,
I know. You take hold of his feet, and I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
lift the head and shoulders, and we'll get
him there somehow. Come, Nathan, we
mustn't delay a minute."</p>

<p>"Have it thine own way, Friend Thomas,"
replied Nathan, as he stooped and grasped
the legs of the wounded officer.</p>

<p>Tom gently lifted the head of the young
lieutenant at the same time, and carefully
across the field the two men began to move
with their burden. Their progress necessarily
was slow, and the lad's fears were not
allayed by the evident alarm of his companion.
Nathan repeatedly glanced behind him, and
several times Tom was compelled to speak
sharply to recall the frightened man to their
present task. The shouts and reports of the
guns were increasing, and Tom's strongest
desire was to avoid attracting the attention of
any of the combatants.</p>

<p>They had safely passed beyond the orchard,
and he was just beginning to hope that their
efforts would be successful, when suddenly
Nathan's hat was lifted from his head and
the sound of a whistling musket-ball was
heard as it passed above them.</p>

<p>For a moment, the startled Nathan looked
down at his hat, and as he perceived the hole
in it which the bullet had made, he instantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
dropped his burden, and turning sharply
about, started in a swift run across the field.</p>

<p>"Come back, Nathan! Come back! Don't
leave me here!" pleaded Tom; but Nathan
did not heed the call.</p>

<p>His pace was a marvelous one for a man
of his years, and as he bent low over the
ground, as if to avoid other bullets which
might be coming toward him, and sped
swiftly forward, under other circumstances
Tom might have felt inclined to laugh at the
ludicrous sight the fleeing man of peace presented.
But as it was he felt much more
inclined to cry than to laugh, and, as he
realized his own helplessness, he knew not
what to do. If he had been alone he might
have followed Nathan and gained a place of
safety, but, as he glanced down upon the
suffering man, who now lay stretched upon
the ground, his whole soul rebelled against
the thought of deserting his friend in a time
like that.</p>

<p>What could he do? The desperate lad
looked about him hoping to discover some
one whom he might summon to his aid. In
the distance he could see the bands of struggling
soldiers, and their shouts and shots
could be clearly heard. But they were all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
intent upon their own contest, and there was
no one who would hear or heed him if he
should call.</p>

<p>He could not abandon his friend&mdash;that
much at least was certain; and at last he
determined to do his utmost to carry the
helpless, wounded man himself. Placing his
arms beneath the shoulders of the unconscious
lieutenant, and striving to rest the
head against his own body, he started slowly
on, dragging the man with him. His progress
was necessarily slow, and he was compelled
to stop frequently, both for his own
sake and that of his friend. Still, on and on
he persistently made his way. The intense
heat of the day, his constant fear that life
would depart from the body he was dragging
forward, the sound of the battle behind him,
all combined to increase his troubles; but
not for a moment did he think of abandoning
his efforts for his friend.</p>

<p>Proceeding slowly, stopping at frequent
intervals and then resuming his efforts, he
steadily drew nearer to the farmhouse he
had perceived in the distance. How much
time had been consumed he could not determine.
The minutes seemed like hours to the
struggling lad. His own danger was all forgotten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
for the time, and the one purpose in
his mind was to carry Lieutenant Gordon to
some place of safety, where it should be possible
to do something for the relief of the
desperately wounded man.</p>

<p>At last, only one more lot remained to be
crossed, and with renewed hope Tom was
about to lift his burden, which he had
dropped for one of his brief rests, when he
suddenly discovered a man running toward
him. Startled and alarmed by the sight he
quickly perceived that the approaching man
was Friend Nathan, who, hatless and with a
dripping face, was soon by his side.</p>

<p>"Thou hast put me to shame, Friend
Thomas," said Nathan soberly. "Thou art
a better man than I, as well as a braver. I
know not why it was, but when my hat was
lifted from my head, and I perceived that
hole the bullet had made, I lost my self-control.
My teaching has been that of peace
and I am poorly prepared for the contests of
war. I will give thee no cause to complain
now."</p>

<p>"Take hold, then," said Tom quickly.
"We must get the lieutenant out of this
heat, or there'll be no hope for him."</p>

<p>Nathan eagerly responded, and tenderly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
lifting the wounded man they proceeded
across the lot.</p>

<p>When they halted for their first rest, Nathan
said, "I have a word to say to thee,
Friend Thomas. What did Washington say
to thee when he heard thy demand for a
recompense for the beast I let thee have?"</p>

<p>"Say? He didn't say anything, because
I didn't say anything to him. You don't
suppose he hadn't anything more to do than
to talk with a boy like me about your old,
broken-winded razor-back, do you? I don't
even know what has become of the beast. I
know I'm glad I don't have to ride it any
more."</p>

<p>"'Tis well, Friend Thomas," replied Nathan,
although Tom thought he discovered
a trace of disappointment in the expression
upon his face. "'Tis well, and I would not
have it otherwise. I have been humiliated
by my weakness in deserting thee, a mere
lad, at such a time as this. I would like also
to restore to you the half-joe you paid me for
my beast." And as Nathan spoke, he drew
the coin from his pocket and held it forth
for Tom to take.</p>

<p>"I don't want your money," said the lad
quickly. "Take hold of the lieutenant again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
and this time we'll not stop before we come
to the house."</p>

<p>Once more they tenderly took up their burden,
and slowly advancing, soon approached
the house. In the doorway a man and a
young woman, evidently his daughter, were
standing, watching the movements of the
approaching men with a curiosity which the
noise of the battle in the distance could not
entirely dispel.</p>

<p>Tom's heart was lighter when he recognized
the man as Jonathan Cook and the
young woman as his daughter Mary.</p>

<p>"We've brought this man here," said
Tom quickly, "to find a resting-place for
him. It's Lieutenant Gordon, and he's
terribly wounded. Will you let us put him
in one of your beds?"</p>

<p>"We will that," said Mr. Cook. "We've
got one poor fellow here now, and will do all
we can for another, too. Take him right in
here," he added, leading the way to a bedroom
adjoining the living-room on the
ground floor.</p>

<p>Tom and Nathan eagerly followed him,
and in a brief time had placed the suffering
man on the high bed. Although the lad
was almost exhausted by his efforts, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Nathan's aid he soon removed the clothing
of the young officer, and then Mary came
and bathed his bleeding face, and with many
expressions of sympathy listened to the story
the weary boy had to tell.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it's been wise or safe
for us to stay here," said Mary, "but we just
couldn't leave the old place until we had to.
We've been keeping watch all day long, and
if the redcoats come this way we shall have
to go. It's been a good thing we've stayed,
though, for Captain Nealey is upstairs and
he's almost as badly wounded as this poor
man is. Oh, it's horrible, horrible!"</p>

<p>But intense as Mary's feelings were, they
did not prevent her from bestowing a very
tender care upon the unconscious young lieutenant,
and as soon as Tom was satisfied that
his friend was receiving better nursing than
he could give, the lad went out of the room.</p>

<p>He discovered Nathan bathing his face and
hands near the water-barrel, which stood beneath
the corner of the eaves, and after he
had followed his example, he began to be
sensible of his own feeling of exhaustion.</p>

<p>"Now, Friend Thomas, thee must lie down
and get some sleep," said Nathan. "I will
assist Mary in her care of thy friend, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
insist that my words he obeyed. The heavy
task has been thine, and my own cowardice
has added to thy burdens, so that now it is
thy turn to rest."</p>

<p>The tired lad was easily persuaded, and
after again going into the room in which the
unconscious lieutenant was lying, he followed
Mr. Cook up the stairs to a room above, and
soon threw himself heavily upon the bed and
fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>It was dark when he awoke, and at first
it was almost impossible for him to recall
the events of the day. They soon returned,
however, and hastily arising, he made his
way down the stairs and entered the living-room,
where he discovered Nathan seated in
one of the large wooden chairs. The moonlight
came in through the open windows, and
as Nathan perceived the lad, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And did sleep come to thee, Friend
Thomas?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm rested now. How's the lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"There has been no change. Mary comes
every hour and bathes his face in cool water
from the well, but he does not open his eyes."</p>

<p>"Is the battle ended? I don't hear any
guns."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know not. Since sunset all has been
quiet, and it is now midnight."</p>

<p>"I'll watch now, and you go upstairs and
get some sleep."</p>

<p>"Nay. I ought not to rest after my cowardice."</p>

<p>"Never mind that. You will do all the
more if you rest awhile now."</p>

<p>Nathan was soon persuaded, and Tom took
his place as watch. He could hear the troubled
breathing of the suffering man, but it
was the only sound to be heard. Outside
the house all was silent, and as the slow
hours passed, the only break which came was
the occasional visit of Mary to bathe the face
of the sufferer.</p>

<p>At daybreak, Mr. Cook brought the news
of the retreat of the British, and great was
the rejoicing in the old farmhouse when it
was learned that at least the Americans had
not suffered defeat in the battle of the preceding
day.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gordon was still living, although
no signs of improvement in his condition
could be discovered. Tom speedily
decided that, as he was not enrolled in the
army, there was nothing to prevent him from
remaining and caring for his friend. Nathan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
also declared that he would return to his aid
as soon as he had gone home and explained
to Rachel the necessity for a further absence,
and the lad did not protest, for he thought
he understood the motive which prompted
the action.</p>

<p>During the day, Mr. Cook brought the
reports of the battle, the hundred prisoners
taken, the number of the dead and wounded,
and the measures which were being taken in
the scattered farmhouses and the old Court-House
for the care of the sufferers.</p>

<p>Tom did not leave the house. His one
thought now was of his wounded friend, and
all that loving hearts and gentle hands could
do was bestowed upon the suffering soldier,
who as yet had not shown that he was aware
of what was going on about him.</p>

<p>The long day passed and the dreary night
followed, but still Tom and Mary cared for
the sufferer. Captain Nealey was said to be
improving rapidly, but no change as yet had
come in the condition of the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>It was the morning of the second day, and
in the early light Tom had gone out to the
water-barrel again to bathe his face and
hands. His heart was heavy, for apparently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Lieutenant Gordon was worse, and all the
efforts of the lad and Mary had produced no
improvement in his condition.</p>

<p>As Tom started to enter the house he
halted upon the doorstep and looked up the
road. A heavy farm wagon drawn by two
horses was approaching, and as it came nearer
the lad suddenly started as he thought he
recognized the team. Surely those were Benzeor
Osburn's horses. A moment later his
suspicions were confirmed, and he knew that
the lumbering wagon was his foster-father's.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AMONG THE PINES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Tom's</span> surprise was still further increased
when he recognized one of the men on the
seat as Little Peter, and by his side a sergeant,
who was driving. It was Little Peter's
condition, however, which quickly drew all of
Tom's attention, for the lad was carrying one
arm in a sling, one of his eyes was discolored,
and the marks of suffering were plainly to be
seen on his face.</p>

<p>Tom quickly ran out into the road, and as
his friend recognized him, at a word from
him the horses stopped, and the two boys
looked at each other for a moment as if each
was trying to understand how it was that
they both were there.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Were you in the
battle?" said Tom, who was the first to
speak.</p>

<p>"No, that is, I wasn't in the battle by the
Court-House. I met Fenton three days ago
up by the old mill, and these are a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
tokens of his regard which he left with me,"
said Little Peter, slightly moving his wounded
arm as he spoke.</p>

<p>As Tom still looked blankly at him, the
lad continued, "I suppose Fenton thought
he left me dead, and it's likely I should
have died if Barzilla Giberson and Jacob
Vannote hadn't found me. They took me
up and carried me over to Benzeor's, though
I <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'did't'">didn't</ins> know anything about it at the time.
Sarah and her mother took such good care
of me that I'm all right now, or at least I'm
a good deal better."</p>

<p>"You don't look as if you ought to be
here," replied Tom. "You say Barzilla and
Jacob found you and took you over to Benzeor's?
I don't understand."</p>

<p>"They're all right; I understand just how
it is now."</p>

<p>"What, Benzeor all right?"</p>

<p>"No, Barzilla and Jacob. I know all
about Benzeor, too," he added in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't been seen or heard from in
four days. I don't think he'll come home
again very soon. Tom, Sarah wanted me to
tell you, if I saw you, that you were to come
home just as soon as you could. I think she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
wants to explain something to you," he
added, noting Tom's expression of surprise.
"Since she's found out about Benzeor she
feels all broken up, and wants you to come
home."</p>

<p>"Then she knows about Benzeor, does
she?" inquired Tom thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, and so do I. You'll go, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"I can't now; perhaps I will after a while,"
and Tom went on to explain the circumstances
which seemed to make his return to Benzeor's
impossible for a time.</p>

<p>"But how does it happen that you are here
so early in the morning, and with Benzeor's
team? You're almost the last person I expected
to see."</p>

<p>"Oh, the way of it is like this. Barzilla
and Jacob and some of the Whigs have been
on the track of Fenton for several days now.
We've got word that he's down in the pines,
about two miles below Blue Ball. Several
parties are out after him, for they've made
up their minds to rid Old Monmouth of the
outlaw, if such a thing can be done. Well,
Barzilla came up to Benzeor's yesterday, and
when he found I was all right again, he suggested
that Ted and I report the matter to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
some of the officers in the American army,
and get a detachment to go down there, so
that's what we've done, you see."</p>

<p>"No, I don't see," replied Tom, looking
about for the detachment of soldiers of which
Little Peter had spoken. "Ted? Ted who?"</p>

<p>"Ted Wilson, if you please," said that
worthy, suddenly rising from beneath the
straw with which the wagon-box was apparently
filled. "I'm the Ted what Little
Peter means. Yes, sir, I'm on the lookout
for those fellows that go around hangin'
Sallies. She's my wife, ye know."</p>

<p>Startled as Tom was by the unexpected
appearance of the mighty Ted, he nevertheless
was compelled to laugh, as the huge man
stood before him striving to shake himself
free from the bits of straw which covered his
face, and shaking his fist at imaginary Fentons,
who went about engaged in the detestable
occupation of "hanging Sallies."</p>

<p>"We saw General Lee yesterday, but he
had so much trouble of his own that he
couldn't listen much to ours," explained
Little Peter, "but he managed to give us a
sergeant and two men. The sergeant here
is driving, and the men are with Ted under
the straw."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom's first thought was to inquire concerning
the trouble of General Lee, which Little
Peter referred to, but Ted interrupted his
question by declaring, "Yes, sir, I've got
two companions in my misery, cooped up
here under the straw. I don't see why they
don't let us sit up straight like men; but no,
they must cover us all over with straw, and
then put two or three barrels in the wagon-box
too. 'Tisn't my way o' doin' things, for
I'd take Jesh and go straight down to the
pines and hang Fenton on the first tree I
found. That's the way I'd do it. But I
suppose I'll have to obey orders."</p>

<p>"That's what you will," said the sergeant,
who had been manifesting signs of impatience
for several minutes. "We mustn't stand here
in the road talking all day. Lie down, Ted,
and we'll cover you up again."</p>

<p>Reluctantly the huge man consented, and
was soon hidden from sight by the straw
which was thrown over him. The barrels
were again arranged to present the appearance
of an ordinary load, and then the sergeant,
picking up the reins which were lying
loose in his hands, spoke to the horses and
started down the road.</p>

<p>Little Peter turned and watched Tom, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
had remained by the roadside, gazing eagerly
after the departing wagon, and when at last
he could see him no longer, once more gave
all his thought to the dangerous expedition
on which he had started with his companions.</p>

<p>Benzeor's horses were in much better condition
than those of his neighbors, for reasons
that are apparent now to all our readers, and
they maintained so steady a pace that by
noontime the party had entered within the
borders of the pines.</p>

<p>The road here became rough and heavy,
and the progress, as a consequence, was correspondingly
slow. The tall stately trees,
the whisperings of the wind, the silence of
the great forest, and above all, the knowledge
that they had entered upon the most dangerous
portion of their journey, made all the
men in the wagon anxious and watchful.
Not a word was spoken now, even Ted
having ceased to complain of his narrow
quarters, and having no remarks to make
concerning the outlaws, whose disposition led
them to go about the country attacking defenseless
men and "hanging Sallies."</p>

<p>Every tree might conceal an enemy, and at
any moment the discharge of a gun might
indicate that their presence had been discovered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
The habitations of men had been left
behind them soon after they had entered the
sombre forests, and the few rude little shanties
near the border, occupied by negroes and
people whose reputation in Old Monmouth
was not of the best, had all been passed.
The vegetation was scanty, and long barren
stretches of sand could be seen on every side.
The sunlight only penetrated the gloom in
places, and its presence served to increase
the dark and sombre appearance of the unbroken
forest.</p>

<p>Little Peter maintained a careful watch
upon one side as they advanced, and the sergeant
watched the other, but they seldom
spoke now, and then only in whispers. The
full sense of the danger of entering a region,
known to be used by the pine robbers as their
headquarters, was appreciated as it had not
been when they started. They had no means
of knowing how many men Fenton might
have with him, and hard as the outlaws were
against the defenseless people of Old Monmouth,
doubtless they would display the honor
which it is said thieves maintain toward one
another, and if others should be within hailing
distance when Fenton was attacked they
would all quickly rally to his assistance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>And the resistance which Fenton himself
would be likely to make was not forgotten.
The vision of him, as he suddenly appeared
to Little Peter on that lonely road to the old
mill a few days previous to this time, came up
before the lad now. His big and burly frame,
his bared and powerful arms, the brutal and
merciless expression upon his evil face, were
all seen again, and the lad shuddered as he
recalled his experiences with him.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" whispered the sergeant
quickly. "See anything?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>Little Peter had not been in the region
since the breaking out of the war, although
before that time he and Tom had made frequent
visits there. Still, he recognized the
locality, and knew the place to which Barzilla
had reported that Fenton had gone. It
was a rude log house, built of the pine-trees,
and could not be more than two miles in
advance of them.</p>

<p>The horses were toiling now as they dragged
the heavy wagon through the deep sand.
Fish-hawks had their nests in the tops of the
lofty trees, and occasionally Peter obtained
a glimpse of the great birds as they sailed in
the air far above him. A brown rabbit now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
and then came forth from his burrow, and
after eying the intruders a moment, would
go bounding away into the thickets, or else
dart swiftly back into his underground home.
The note of a wood-thrush now and again
broke in upon the stillness with its clear,
sweet whistle, and the watchful men would
glance quickly about them, almost thinking
that the sound was the call of the pine robbers
to one another.</p>

<p>Little Peter's fear and the pain he was
suffering from his recent encounter with Fenton
made his face pale, and as the sergeant
again turned to him and marked his appearance,
he said, "'T was too bad, my lad, that
you had to come."</p>

<p>"I knew the way. I had to come and show
you."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I know it, but it's hard, for
all that."</p>

<p>"We're almost there now. The place
can't be more than a quarter of a mile farther
on."</p>

<p>The sergeant did not reply, but turned
quickly at the words, and peered keenly
into the forest before him. No one could
be seen, and the tall trees guarded well their
secret. The toiling horses were pulling steadily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
on their load, and they, at least, felt no
alarm; but Little Peter and his companion
were anxious now, and were keeping their
eyes steadily fixed upon the road before
them.</p>

<p>"There! That's the place!" whispered the
lad excitedly, as he obtained a glimpse of a
little clearing not far in advance of them.</p>

<p>The sergeant did not reply, but he tightened
his grasp upon the reins, and glanced
down at the gun which he had placed within
easy reach. Little Peter's excitement had
become intense, and he was peering eagerly
ahead of him, while his breathing was quick
and hard. They would soon know what the
result of the expedition was to be.</p>

<p>The heavy wagon came out into the clearing,
and drew near to the one small house,
which was standing within it. The house
was of logs, and corresponded exactly to the
description which Barzilla had given of it.
As yet, no human being had been seen, and
the sergeant was just about to declare that
the place was not inhabited when the door
was suddenly opened and a man stepped forth
to view. Evidently he had heard the sounds
of the approaching wagon, and had come out
to investigate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a tall, broad-shouldered, powerful-appearing
man. He was clad in a pair of
rough trousers and high boots, which looked
as if they might have belonged to some Hessian
dragoon at one time, and the red flannel
shirt which partially covered his chest could
not entirely conceal the great bunches of
muscle there. In one hand he grasped a
pistol, and the expression upon his face might
well have caused a man with a much stouter
heart than Little Peter had to tremble.</p>

<p>The sergeant glanced inquiringly at the
lad by his side, and Little Peter nodded his
head in reply to the unspoken question. The
man was Fenton himself,&mdash;the one who had
robbed the widows and the fatherless, had
made the midnight attacks upon the defenseless
people of Old Monmouth, had hanged
trembling women from the limbs of trees,
and tortured his helpless victims into revealing
the places where their scanty savings
had been concealed. He had been the
leader of bands as desperate and wicked as
himself, and the suffering and woe which
the good people of the surrounding region
had experienced at his hands can never be
told. And now the man himself stood waiting
for the wagon, in which were Little Peter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
himself a victim of the pine robbers' cruelty,
and his companions, to approach.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" called Fenton. "You're
movin' too fast. What ye doin' here?"</p>

<p>The sergeant stopped his horses, and as
Fenton approached and stood near the wheel,
he said, "We've come down here to look for
a man we want to find."</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll do as well as any other.
Look at me! Ye're not goin' any farther,
ye might as well understand that now as any
time. Got a bottle with ye?"</p>

<p>The sergeant drew forth a bottle of brandy
and handed it to the outlaw. Fenton took
it, and raised one foot upon the hub of the
wheel. As he lifted the bottle to his lips,
his eyes fell upon Little Peter, who had been
endeavoring to conceal himself behind his
companion.</p>

<p>Instantly recognizing the lad, he shouted,
"You here? You? I thought I left ye
dead up by the mill the other day! You
rascal! One whipping wasn't enough, was
it? I'll give ye what ye deserve now!"</p>

<p>Fenton reached back with one hand to
grasp the pistol he had thrust into his
pocket when he had taken the bottle.
Quickly the sergeant kicked the foot of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Ted Wilson under the straw, and instantly
the men arose, and before Fenton could act,
had brought their guns to their shoulders
and the reports rang out together.</p>

<p>The pine robber pitched heavily forward,
and lay dead upon the sand. Oh, it was
horrible, awful! A sensation of sickness, of
faintness, swept over Little Peter as he looked
down upon the face of the dead outlaw.</p>

<p>"What's that? What's that?" said Ted
quickly.</p>

<p>It was the sound of a gun not far away.
It might be the answer of other bands of pine
robbers to the volley which had just been
fired; and hurriedly throwing the body of
Fenton into the wagon, the sergeant turned
his horses about and started swiftly back up
the road.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CONCLUSION</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of the heavy sand the horses were
driven swiftly, until their heaving sides and
dripping flanks compelled their driver to give
them a much-needed rest. Ted Wilson and
one of the soldiers then leaped lightly to the
ground and ran into the woods on either
side of the road to ascertain whether they
were pursued or not.</p>

<p>As the silence of the great forest was unbroken
they speedily returned, and the flight
was resumed. No one was concealed beneath
the straw in the wagon-box now, and every
one stood waiting and ready to share in the
defense which at any moment might become
necessary.</p>

<p>On past the tall pine-trees, on through the
heavy sandy road, rushed the returning party,
and at last, when they obtained a glimpse of
the open country, they breathed a sigh of
relief as they realized that the danger of
immediate pursuit was gone. It was not until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
nearly a year after this time that they learned
that the gun they had heard had been discharged
by De Bow, the desperate leader of
another band of outlaws as evil in every way
as those whom the detested Fenton had himself
led.</p>

<p>It was near the close of the day when the
party, of which Little Peter was a member,
drove up to Monmouth Court-House. Carelessly,
almost brutally, the sergeant and one
of his companions seized the body of the dead
outlaw, and flinging it from the wagon into
one of the trenches the soldiers had made,
shouted, "Here's a cordial for your tories
and wood robbers!"</p>

<p>Little Peter had no share in the rejoicing
which followed when it was known that the
pine robber was no more. It was true, he
knew Fenton had richly deserved his fate,
and that no more would the defenseless people
of Old Monmouth suffer from the evil
deeds of his marauding band. He, too, had
known something of Fenton's wickedness, for
he was motherless, homeless, and almost
fatherless because of him, and his own body for
many days bore the traces of his meeting with
him on his return from the mill; but in spite
of all that, his heart was sick whenever he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
thought of the dead face he had seen looking
up at him from the wagon-box, and the brutal
rejoicings of the men who had shot him near
his abode among the pines.</p>

<p>On the following day Tom Coward returned
to Benzeor's house for a brief visit, reporting
a very decided improvement in the condition
of young Lieutenant Gordon. A long interview
between Tom and Sarah followed, and
as the troubled girl explained to the lad what
she had learned concerning the evil deeds of
her own father, and begged him to return
and aid her in caring for the family in the
presence of such dangers and perplexities,
Tom could not find it in his heart to refuse.
The kindness bestowed upon him in the home,
and the obligations to repay as best he could
the care he himself had received there, were
too strong to be ignored, and greatly to the
joy of Sarah and her mother he yielded to
their urgent pleas. He had not yet enlisted
in the army, and so was free to decide the
question for himself.</p>

<p>He was aided in making the decision by
the fact that Little Peter was also to remain.
His own home had been destroyed, and as
there was no place to which he could take his
little brothers and sisters, there was every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
reason why he should accept the invitation
and increase the defenses of the household.</p>

<p>It was not considered probable that Benzeor
would return, nor was it known what had become
of the man, who had gradually and yet
steadily been drawn into the power of the
pine robbers, until at last he was considered
by them all as one of themselves, and indeed
he was. Neither the boys nor Sarah knew
then whither he had gone. Tom thought he
might have been killed in the battle, and it
was not until more than a year had passed
that word came from the missing Benzeor;
but where he had been and what he had been
doing do not belong to this story.</p>

<p>On the day following the great battle of
Monmouth, General Lee had, to a certain extent,
recovered from his chagrin at the public
rebuke General Washington had administered
to him, and in his arrogance, and as a relief
to his feeling of mortification, he wrote a childish
letter to the commander, demanding an
apology for the words he had spoken in the
presence of the soldiers.</p>

<p>Washington's reply to Lee's letter was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I received your letter, expressed,
as I conceive, in terms highly improper. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
am not conscious of making use of any very
singular expressions, at the time of meeting
you, as you intimate. What I recollect
to have said was dictated by duty and warranted
by the occasion. As soon as circumstances
will permit, you shall have an opportunity
of justifying yourself to the army, to
Congress, to America, and to the world in
general; or of convincing them that you were
guilty of a breach of orders, and of misbehavior
before the enemy on the 28th instant,
in not attacking them as you had been directed,
and in making an unnecessary, disorderly, and
shameful retreat."</p>

<p>Lee's reply to this letter, as impudent as it
was childish, certainly did not tend to elevate
him in the estimation of the men of his own
time, or of ours. His letter was as follows:
"You cannot afford me greater pleasure than
in giving me the opportunity of showing to
America the sufficiency of her respective servants.
I trust that temporary power of office,
and the tinsel dignity attending it, will not
be able, by all the mists they can raise, to
obfuscate the bright rays of truth."</p>

<p>Washington's reply to this insulting letter
was to arrest Lee. The traitor was at once
court-martialed and charged with disobedience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
of orders, misbehavior on the field, making a
disgraceful retreat, and also with gross disrespect
to his commander-in-chief. The trial
lasted more than a month, and the result was
that Lee was suspended for the term of one
year. If strict justice had been measured out
to the man, doubtless he would not have
escaped with so light a sentence; but Washington
was merciful, and although Lee did
not appreciate the kindness shown him, he
owed his life to the man whose heart and
mind were so much greater than his own.</p>

<p>General Washington did not long delay in
Old Monmouth after the battle. The British
army had gained New York, and so the
American commander moved to the Hudson,
and on the 20th of July went into camp at
White Plains, having left some of the militia
to look well to the needs of the country in
which the great battle had been fought.</p>

<p>And Monmouth was a great battle. Not
only did the men struggle with a determination
such as has been seldom displayed, but
the results of the engagement itself were also
marked and strong. While the two armies,
after Washington had gone to the Hudson
and Clinton to New York, occupied much
the same relative positions as in the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
part of '76, the motives which controlled each
were exactly reversed. The Americans now
became the aggressors, and the British were
compelled to defend themselves.</p>

<p>All this was intensified by the action of
France. Benjamin Franklin had succeeded
in arranging a treaty between that land and
ours. France was to send a fleet of sixteen
war vessels under D'Estaing to our shores,
and also an army of four thousand men. It
was the coming of this fleet which, as we
know, caused the British to depart from Philadelphia
and hasten to the defense of New
York, which place they thought would be
first attacked. The march of the redcoats
and Hessians across New Jersey gave Washington
an opportunity to pursue them, and
while he failed in accomplishing all that he
hoped, and much that he might have done
had it not been for the treacherous actions of
Lee, still he virtually had won a victory. He
compelled the British to retreat with great
losses, he strengthened his own position, he
silenced his enemies in Congress, and, above
all, he aroused a new feeling of hope and
determination in the hearts of the struggling
Americans.</p>

<p>The British very promptly declared war<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
against France, and then coolly invited the
Americans to join them, promising all that
the colonists had asked three years before
this time. The offer had come too late, however,
for now the colonies had become States,
and independence had been declared, and independence
the new nation would have. So
the war was continued, but the part which
the new allies took and the further struggles
of the determined Americans belong to another
story.</p>

<p>It only remains to refer briefly to the experiences
of our friends, whose fortunes we
have followed in the course of this book.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gordon at last recovered from
his wound. Tom Coward divided his time
between caring for his friend and the labor
on Benzeor's farm. In the former task he
was aided by Friend Nathan Brown until
such a time as the young lieutenant could be
removed to his own home.</p>

<p>Friend Nathan had been unable to remain
away from the battle of Monmouth, and while
both his feelings and professions had prevented
him from entering into the struggle,
still his interest had been so intense that he
had started from his home to the scene of the
struggle. There he met Tom, and the part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
he then took in caring for the wounded young
officer we already know.</p>

<p>Neither Tom nor Little Peter was idle.
There was much work to be done on both
farms, and the lads aided each other. The
crop on the ten-acre lot was successfully
grown and harvested, and the immediate
problem of food in Benzeor's household was
in a measure solved.</p>

<p>Indian John was never seen by our boys
again. Whether he had been slain by the
British or the pine robbers, or had departed
from the homes of his ancestors for a region
into which the redcoats and buffcoats did
not enter, was never known. Both Tom
and Little Peter were inclined to the latter
conclusion, however, and their opinion was
strengthened by the fact that "Charlie"
Moluss, and his wife Bathsheba, and her sister
"Suke" were never seen or heard from
again.</p>

<p>Several times the boys made their way into
Indian John's cave by the brook, but they
never discovered any signs of their friend.
He had forever disappeared, but his stories
concerning the origin of the Jersey mosquitoes,
his interpretations of the roar of the
ocean and the calls of the sea-birds, and above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
all the assistance he had rendered Little Peter
in the trying days of '78 were never forgotten.</p>

<p>Weeks had passed before Little Peter positively
learned that Benzeor's statement concerning
his father had been correct, but at
last he received definite information that he
was a prisoner in New York. What that
meant to the troubled lad, few of us to-day
can understand. The sufferings on board
the prison-ships and in the prison-houses of
New York almost baffle description; but we
may be sure of one thing, and that is that
Little Peter did not sit idly down, nor rest
content to leave his father where he was
without making some efforts in his behalf.
But that, too, belongs to another record.</p>

<p>Barzilla Giberson and Jacob Vannote
after the death of Fenton did not find it
necessary to play a double part. They believed
that their efforts to run the pine robbers
to cover had been successful, and that
now they could boldly and openly take their
stand on the side of the patriots. And take
that stand they did, and their services in the
New Jersey militia are known in all the
region of Old Monmouth.</p>

<p>Ted Wilson, with Jeshurun "waxen fatter"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
and consequently still more inclined to
kick, returned to his home after the death of
Fenton. He found Sallie and the babies
safe at the Dennises, but all of the mighty
Ted's former indifference as to his rulers had
departed. The taste of the struggle he had
had seemed only to whet his appetite for
more, and not many days had passed before
Ted and Jeshurun once more started forth
in quest of service and adventure.</p>

<p>Sarah Osburn labored faithfully and cheerfully
for the welfare of her enlarged household,
and the boys did not fail to appreciate
her kindness. Tom thought he understood
the motive which prompted much of her care
for Little Peter's younger brothers and sisters,
but throughout the long absence of
Benzeor he never directly or indirectly referred
to it.</p>

<p>There was a brief lull in the outrages and
attacks of the pine robbers after the death
of Fenton, but it was very brief. Stephen
Burke (or Stephen Emmons as he was sometimes
called), Stephen West, Ezekiel Williams,
Jonathan West, Richard Bird, Davenport,
De Bow, and others were yet living, and as
each was the leader of a band as desperate
as himself, and as all were as reckless and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
brave as Fenton had been, in a brief time
the suffering people of Old Monmouth found
that their troubles were by no means ended.</p>

<p>Redcoat and buffcoat were again to contend
within their borders, salt-works and
houses were to be burned, gunboats were to
anchor off her shore and their crews were to
engage in conflicts with the patriots; whigs
and tories were not yet reconciled, the pine
robbers were not yet subdued. Five long
and terrible years of the struggle of the
Revolution were yet to come, and the sands
of Old Monmouth were again and again to
be dyed by the blood of fallen men.</p>

<p>The waves which came creeping, crawling
up the long sandy shore, the tall pine-trees
whose tops whispered together as they bent
beneath the summer winds and winter storms,
the fertile plains and noble forests of oak
and chestnut, were unchanged; but the
struggling men and women of Old Monmouth
were yet to endure the bitter hardships
and fierce contests, which the closing
days of the Revolution brought to them in
greater numbers than to almost any other
people of our land.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
